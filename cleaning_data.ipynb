       "85224    yeah. i think too many things are lining up right now. on a smaller scale musk could distort it *somehow*, but with sites state + resulting debris + full on losing control *and* flight termination delay + mishap grounding + scs recent success + elon being directly tied to issues with the launch, itâ€™s a **lot** to try to push back. \\n\\neverything that you try to deal with individually collapses in context of the next. i guarantee musk will be applying insane amounts of pressure to try to rush repairing site + ending investigation, because itâ€™s likely to be a **serious fucking problem** for space x if they canâ€™t find some way to minimize it or eek out some tiny win. \\n\\nright now their best seems to be something along the lines of â€˜uh yeah we used the older booster that has a lot identified and fixed problems, donâ€™t worry the new booster is betterâ€™. but even then musk canâ€™t generate any a bit hype: this was a \"50% chance of making it off the platform\", the next launch is just \"better than 50%\", **and** they dont have a platform right now.\n",
