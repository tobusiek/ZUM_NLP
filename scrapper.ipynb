I\\'m looking for literate partners who are laid back and not afraid to have fun!

While he’s lifted restrictions on many previously suspended accounts including former President Donald Trump’s, he’s also placed new limitations on journalists’ and others’ accounts for posting publicly available flight information that he equated to doxxing.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe saga of Musk’s Twitter takeover has underscored the complexity of determining what speech is truly protected. That question is particularly difficult when it comes to online platforms, which create policies that impact wide swaths of users from different cultures and legal systems across the world.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThis year, the U.S. justice system, including the Supreme Court, will take on cases that will help determine the bounds of free expression on the internet in ways that could force the hand of Musk and other platform owners who determine what messages get distributed widely.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe boundaries they will consider include the extent of platforms’ responsibility to remove terrorist content and prevent their algorithms from promoting it, whether social media sites can take down messaging on the basis of viewpoint and whether the government can impose online safety standards that some civil society groups fear could lead to important resources and messages being stifled to avoid legal liability.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n“The question of free speech is always more complicated than it looks,” said David Brody, managing attorney of the Digital Justice Initiative at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law. “There’s a freedom to speak freely. But there’s also the freedom to be free from harassment, to be free from discrimination.”\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBrody said whenever the parameters of content moderation get tweaked, people need to consider “whose speech gets silenced when that dial gets turned? Whose speech gets silenced because they are too fearful to speak out in the new environment that is created?”\\n\\nRead more: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/30/the-supreme-court-could-change-free-speech-on-the-internet.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/30/the-supreme-court-could-change-free-speech-on-the-internet.html)',\n",

       "  'body': 'I will volunteer to be that \"motherfucker\" then!!!! \\n\\nBefore i begin. I find it interesting that this is your first ever comment in an AMC thread. Ever. Its also remarkable that you are 100% football until the mention of the vote, and you come after someone clearly voting Yes (me. I\\'m voting Yes to everything). Quite aggresively too. \\n\\nOnto it then. \\n\\nYou all go off the same narrative of \"having your shit cut\". \\n\\nI have posted this in a few other places, so i will post it here. Everytime it makes me more efficient at combating this directive you all have. \\n\\n100 shares @ 100 dollars = 10 shares @ 100 dollars. \\n\\nThe only difference is that if it doesn\\'t reverse split, they can knock us off the NYSE due to shorting us under a dollar. It is a hell of a lot harder to short us under a dollar at 70$ /share than at 7$/share. They simply do not have that much time. \\n\\nThe fake news and corporate owned journalists also loves our smaller dollar value becuase if we are at 7$ a share and drop one dollar they can advertise it as a 14% loss and they will bash us in all kinds of ways. If we lose a dollar on a 70$ it is a 1.4% loss and they can\\'t milk that in their favor. Fake news owned by hedgies like Motely Fool and Bazinga would love to advertise a high % drop.\\n\\nIf you look at the recently revealed playbook for trapping shorts, it shows that Reverse Splits calibrate the movements to trap hedge funds that are short. \\n\\nBy reverse splitting, it will also be easier to expose naked shares. It is a hell of a lot easier to track and verify the validity of 10 large items people owe you, than to track 100 small items. \\n\\nWould you rather have 10 - $10 bills in your pocket, or 100 - 1$ bills ? \\n\\nIf someone sketchy owed you $100, would you rather have them pay you back with 10- $10 bills, or 100- $1 bills? What do you think has a higher odds of numerical error or attempt at foul play? It is much better to have the 10- $10 bills. \\n\\n\"BUt WhAT AbOUt hAvInG MoRE CuRrEnCy? I dOnT WaNt tO HaVe FeWEr BiLLs!\" Is the same logic to the money in my example as comparing the share count to the price/share.\\n\\nNow, a good tactic for logic is working backwards. Let\\'s say a reverse split is bad (it\\'s not. A Reverse Split is good. But let\\'s use your shillogic) then by theory, a massive dilution is logical. If concentrating = bad. Then diluting = good? That\\'s your focus... is share number... so, in your mindset with that math about having a lot of shares regardless of value/share, let\\'s dilute ×1000!!! That way, we get sooooo many more shares!!!!??? \\n\\nWould you rather have 1 US dollar or 322 ZWL (Zimbabwe dollars) ? Why on earth would you want to concentrate 322 of something into 1 of something better!!!????? \\n\\nDo you see how ridiculous your logic is?\\n\\nThis is what is in the \\'No\\' category of commentors - Zero to none AMC history, zero to none posts on AMC or none at all, a clear start date from when they start talking about AMC, a focus ONLY on the vote even if the thread has no mentions about a vote, Deleted accounts after they fuck up thier arguments (this cracks me up. Let me delete my 1 year old account because a guy disagrees with me about something I own?), their profiles are riddled with [deleted] and [removed], they try to bundle with the group saying, \"look guys\" or \"everyone thinks\" to make it seem like everything is in common mind with them, they all have a clear directive, etc etc etc. I have a post with 4 months of reddit research on the shilling characteristics... they are all the same. \\n\\nI am Voting Yes to a Reverse Split, Yes to a Conversion, and when it comes, Yes to a Delist and Relist of the stock. Or we can go private and previous share holders now own their company without it being at risk of short sellers. That\\'s why Tesla stock shot up when Musk threatened privatization... that\\'s the only reason why he threatened that, and the only reason he got in trouble was because it would have forced positions to close and destabilized markets. \\n\\nI am Voting Yes. Look at the profiles of everyone saying to vote No, then look at my post of things shills have in common.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Because the batteries are huge and heavy, which works against itself as far as range goes. Buses run fixed routes and are a perfect use case for overhead wires and pantographs, at least on certain routes in the city where the density and ridership can pay for the infrastructure costs.            \\n         \\nTrolley buses are a lot lighter, less complex, and cost less per vehicle. Maintaining overheard wires is not very expensive. The bus lane issue can be resolved by making bus lanes. And IIRC, trolley buses are able to change lanes, if not somewhat limited. Which is why they're advantageous over railed trolleys. Battery buses will need a decent amount of downtime for recharging. If they have batteries that can be switched out, this is not a rapid procedure and requires many spare batteries. Though this can increase the longevity of the batteries as rapid charging reduces lifespan.              \\n             \\nIf the goal is to reduce carbon emissions, batteries are not really an optimal choice. Sure, right now their goal is just to reduce air pollution in the urban core. But we should be focused on the long term. Batteries still have a lot of carbon emissions associated with them. Frankly, this obsession with battery electric vehicles as the solution to the climate crisis is a grift sold to us by charlatans by elon musk. It's marginally better than internal combustion, but the real solution is a shift to more public transit, and that transit should be better too.             \\n             \\nAnd regardless of all that, they just do not have the range yet to make them a good fleet vehicle. Battery electric makes sense for a POV that spends most of its time sitting, not for a fleet vehicle that spends most of it's time moving. Sure, there's improvements to chemistry and energy recapture every year, but they will always be inferior to buses that run off mains which do all of the same stuff. The only upside is flexibility. Sure not every route is appropriate for a trolleybus, but a lot of the routes at the core of the system are. It honestly disgusts me that it seems like this isn't being entertained by the people in charge.\",\n",

And we will not win elections unless we give people a reason to vote for us. 有理由对我们的国家感到乐观。为美国复兴项目贡献时间、精力和资源的理由。在我看来，我们面前有三项主要任务。\\n\\n首先，我们需要让华尔街重新平衡我们的国内经济。 在最好的情况下，美国的资本市场通过将有好想法的人与有钱投资于好想法的人联系起来，促进了增长和创新。在最糟糕的情况下，我们的市场就像一个庞氏骗局，在榨取短期利润的同时让我们的国家、社区和小企业陷入贫困。不幸的是，[21世纪](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/5/rubio-releases-report-on-domestic-investment)的美国金融更像是庞氏骗局。\\n\\n也许最明显的例子是华尔街将现金注入由中国共产党直接或间接控制的公司。任何国家都无法通过向对手提供工作和金钱来生存。几十年前开始时还很天真，现在已经愚蠢到危险的地步。\\n\\n当然，对于调整我们与中国的经济关系以及让金融回到我们经济中适当和富有成效的位置，存在着巨大的反对意见。令人难以置信的财富和政治影响力与现状息息相关。但这种现状正在削弱美国。美国政府必须在改变使我们走到这一步的激励结构方面发挥积极作用。这意味着加强工具来阻止和惩罚破坏国家安全的投资，并激励投资者将资金带回美国，并将其用于振兴我们的创新和生产能力。\\xa0\\n\\n我们的第二项任务是将关键产业带回美国。 有些人可能会倾向于称这是对 Covid 引起的供应链中断的过度反应。但是，尽管这场大流行病确实让人们睁开了眼睛，但[振兴国内生产的必要性多年来一直显而易见——](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/2/rubio-releases-report-outlining-china-s-plan-for-global-dominance-and-why-america-must-respond)尽管只有那些愿意挑战华盛顿传统智慧的人才会如此。我们需要积极的[亲美产业政策](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/5/rubio-argues-for-american-industrial-policy-in-legislative-efforts-to-combat-china)。\\n\\n最近对美国半导体制造的投资是重要的一步，尽管拜登政府对在中国开展业务的芯片公司的[慷慨分拆](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/marco-rubio-warns-chips-bill-loopholes-china-cant-support-this)表明它并没有认真对待北京方面的强硬态度。如果未经选举的官僚对与中国公司共享技术的请求开绿灯，那么实施出口管制就毫无意义。\\n\\n美国的漏洞清单很长。从先进电池所需的[稀土矿物](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/rubio-hyde-smith-introduce-bill-to-kickstart-american-rare-earth-manufacturing)到救生药物所需的[活性药物成分](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=122B4FE1-7C99-40EF-AB96-B5CD5FAC37E8)，我们都依赖像中国这样的敌对外国。在典型的官僚风格中，美国的发展和政府融资组织之间的协调为零。至少，我们必须让这些组织共同努力，[投资于真正重要的事情](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=840DCDD2-27DC-49C7-8C3D-078CE70C37C2)。\\xa0\\n\\n最后，我们有义务重建美国的劳动力。 首先，如果没有强大、充满活力的劳动力，就不可能恢复美国工业。但工作也关乎人的尊严。全球化和外包摧毁了数百万美国人获得稳定和繁荣生活的唯一可靠途径。家庭破裂了。社区崩溃了。死亡和绝望取代了他们。[我们需要通过恢复工作的尊严来开辟新的道路](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/help-working-class-voters-us-must-value-work/578032/)。\\xa0\\n\\n这并不容易。上个月，80 名参议员投票决定对铁路工人实施一项劳工协议——该协议剥夺了工人一天的带薪病假。他们与铁路公司和华尔街一起，[以牺牲工人](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/bidens-rail-debacle-signals-shakeup/)、他们的家庭和他们的社区为代价，优先考虑股东利润最大化。[我们在亚马逊](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/rubio-brown-call-for-federal-investigation-into-amazon-s-labor-practices)看到了同样的对效率的一心一意的痴迷。清单还在继续。\\n\\n改变始于我们作为共和党人如何看待传统有组织的劳工的作用。如果工会确实在促进其成员的福利，我们可以而且应该与工会合作。我们可能会在对可怕的工作条件、计算机算法监控以及来自外国的不公平竞争的担忧上找到共同点。但是，如果工会想捍卫[廉价外国劳动力](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-feb-17-mn-65389-story.html)的进口，并迫使美国人每天接受[最新的唤醒风潮](https://nwlc.org/unions-can-protect-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-workers-despite-trumps-doj/)，那么我们就需要寻求[替代机制](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/rubio-banks-introduce-pro-worker-labor-reform-bill)来支持工人。\\xa0\\n\\n为了重建我们的劳动力，我们还需要取消[传统的四年制大学模式](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/3/rubio-bennet-introduce-alternative-to-accreditation-that-shifts-focus-to-student-success)，并加强非学位途径，这些途径可以在不背负多年学生债务的情况下找到高薪工作。\\xa0\\n\\n当然，还有很多事情要做。\\xa0\\n\\n我们的学校是灌输马克思主义的污水池。危险的学术结构，如批判种族理论和激进的性别理论，正被强加给小学生。共和党州长和学校董事会成员处于这些斗争的前线，但他们需要增援。我们需要确保[没有联邦资金](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/8/rubio-cramer-braun-introduce-legislation-to-prohibit-federal-funding-of-critical-race-theory-in-american-history-and-civics-education)被用于在学校推广这些激进的想法。我们还应确保调查家长或学生提出的关于学校课程或辅导促进这些分裂概念的\\xa0[每一项投诉。](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/7/rubio-introduces-bill-to-protect-students-from-racially-hostile-school-environments-caused-by-critical-race-theory)\\n\\n为生命而战也仍然是一个优先事项。我们党内有太多人，尤其是在选举期间，逃避了堕胎辩论。未出生的婴儿不会因为临近投票日而变得更有价值或更不值钱。至少，我们应该通过对四个月后的堕胎实施合理的规定，使我们国家的法律与西欧的法律保持一致。我们还必须做更多的工作来[支持母亲和她们的孩子](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/the-providing-for-life-act-a-pro-life-plan-for-post-roe-america)。\\xa0\\n\\nBig Tech 仍然过于强大，也。我希望 Elon Musk 能够弄清楚 Twitter，但仅仅因为他负责并不意味着该应用程序应该在联邦法律中有特殊的例外。推特、脸书、谷歌等，应该像它们本身的出版商一样对待。像亚马逊这样的公司不应该获得免费通行证来剥削工人和小企业。如果科技公司拥有或可能被迫与北京共享数据，则不应允许其在这里运营。\\n\\n这些甚至都没有涉及我们国家面临的众多外交政策挑战。\\xa0\\n\\n我们在该领域的最大任务可能是迫使过时的外交政策集团——在整个 Acela 走廊的国务院、情报界和智囊团内部运作的根深蒂固的老卫士——重新确定优先次序并关注美国最紧迫的威胁：中国共产党。这将需要权衡取舍和分担责任。\\xa0\\n\\n我们许多所谓的专家都是在冷战之后成年的。因此，他们的世界观是由一种天真的信念所塑造的，即自由民主是每个国家不可避免的最终状态。就美国面临的严重威胁而言，它来自伊朗和朝鲜等恐怖分子或流氓政权，而不是势均力敌的对手。这些想法深深植根于他们的心灵。这有助于解释为什么美国衰落的礼貌维护者会不遗余力地安抚中国的共产主义政权。\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n但我们生活在不同的时代，有着不同的需求。我们需要认识到，习近平领导的中国即使不是更大的威胁，也与曾经的苏联一样是一个巨大的威胁。21世纪，欧洲必须走在欧洲的前列。德国、法国和英国完全有能力处理好与东部拥有核武器的交战国的关系。但只要他们能依赖美国，他们就永远不会拥有所有权。如果这是一场福利政策辩论，保守派就会呼吁工作要求。对于欧洲，我们需要类似的东西，鼓励我们的盟友掌握他们的未来、安全和繁荣。\\n\\n在整个太平洋地区，我们需要继续授权我们的盟友和合作伙伴在该地区做更多事情。台湾、韩国、日本、澳大利亚、印度和其他国家是对抗共产主义中国的重要堡垒。我们需要尽自己的一份力量，包括切断美国资本流向中国公司，保护知识产权免受中国间谍活动的侵害，将关键供应链移出共产主义国家，以及将军事资产转移到印太地区。但除非亚洲和欧洲的盟友和伙伴加入这项事业，否则这些努力将毫无意义。如果拜登任命的人继续掌舵，他们也不太可能加入这项事业。[当我们有穿着高跟鞋和口红的人代表美国参加高级别外交会议](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10520757/Biden-taps-non-binary-drag-queen-look-nuclear-waste.html)时，其他国家怎么能把我们当回事呢？\\n\\n#### 今天订阅\\n\\n##### 在您的收件箱中获取每周电子邮件\\n\\n电子邮件地址：\\n\\n显然，我们面临着许多挑战。但尽管如此，我还是对美国的未来感到乐观。世界上没有其他国家的我，一个移民调酒师和全职妈妈的儿子，会处于这个位置。如果我要袖手旁观，而我们的国家只是世界历史上的一个注脚，我会被诅咒的。因为事实是，如果美国失败了，我就无处可去。\\xa0\\n\\n左派将在一个堕落的美国如鱼得水，它向其公民分发可卡因烟斗，在一个由无神论的共产主义政权统治的世界中。但是，如果没有一个强大的美国，世界上就不会容许那些相信人人生而平等，造物主赋予他们某些不可剥夺的权利，并且这些权利应该受到政府保护的人。\\xa0\\n\\n我们不能让这样的未来成为现实。这就是为什么在接下来的六年里，我将专注于将共和党重建为一个愿意为这个国家而战并开创美国新世纪的多种族工人阶级联盟。\\xa0',\n",

I’m pretty sure my ass had started to fuse with the damn seat of my car after that car ride, long drives and heat don’t mix. Still, I’ve pulled worse trips before and I had a task to handle, though not exactly one I’m looking forward to.\\n\\nSee, my grandfather recently passed away, heart failure at the age of 74. To say it was unexpected would be an understatement, as by all intents he was reasonably healthy for his age. I got the news after I finished my finals, and it felt like I was blindsided by a brick. Loved Grandpa James, he encouraged me to pursue my passion for science and engineering when I was a kid, even helped fund my college tuition. I’m really gonna miss him.\\n\\nThe funeral was about a month ago, a pretty sizable one really. Gramps was beloved by the whole family and made plenty of friends who wanted to pay their respects. Still, the hardest hit among us was grandma, hence my trip.\\n\\nMom recommended I take some time to stay with grandma for a bit, keep her company and help her adjust. She had been married to grandpa for some 50 years, not exactly something you get over in the span of a month. I always liked spending time with grandma, so I was happy to help. Besides, I hadn’t had much time to visit her lately with my studies occupying much of my time, so it would be nice to catch up.\\n\\nThe passage of time apparently affected my dear grandmother in some more…unique ways then most. You know how older folk shrink with age? Apparently this was happening to her at a more impressive scale then most (my mother said it was a genetic thing, didn’t elaborate on that). Well, knowing my grandmother, she’d probably just make light of the changes and ask if I’d gotten thin (even though I’ve always been thin). \\n\\n///\\n\\nHello all!\\n\\nGot a fun one today!

Thanks for reading through my prompt, hope you liked it! I'm looking to get super kinky with this one, since there's a whole lot of fun to be had. The initial premise is really dark, but it's certainly going to get lighter eventually, though your character might need to use a bit of force in the beginning.\\n\\nThe house will be full of other dolls, so I'm willing to control them as well if they're in a scene, but if you have any fun ideas for them, we can definitely split them between us \\n\\nI'm into pretty much everything that isn't vore, hyper, furry and porn logic. I'm fine with unrealistic things, as long as there's a decent, well thought out explanation behind it all.\\n\\nMy favourites are mommy dom, cuddles, face sitting, big dicks, cum play, spit play, sweat, musk, pubes, humiliation, degradation, toilet play, anal, everything oral, curvy, noncon, dubcon, age gaps, size differences, futa, pubes, and probably a hundred others that I can't remember at this point.\\n\\nIf you're willing to get really filthy with this, you definitely get bonus points, but good writing trumps all!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this prompt, and would like to play it out with me, send me a message with the word *beige* in your title. Please include kinks, limits, and any ideas for this story. I'm very flexible, so I'm open to changing up some stuff if your ideas are good!\",\n",

Oops.\\nBut that\\'s irrelevant, we live in the here and now. \\n\\nSo, without further ado, I\\'m gonna lay things out. \\n\\nI\\'m Sammy, a horndog with a **fat dick** and **nice abs**. I\\'ve been RPing for years, many of \\'em, lost count. With those years come experience and, of course, standards.\\nI can write hefty paragraphs of detailed smut with ease and I expect the same from you. More on that later.\\nAs far as personality goes, I\\'m fairly laid back, pretty easy to get along with and hopelessly narcissistic. A cocky canine who knows she\\'s the business. I\\'ve got an big ol\\' ego and I value those who know just how to stroke it.\\nSpeaking of strokes, I should probably list *some* of the stuff I\\'m into.\\nSweat, musk, sloppy stuff, anal, condoms, creampies, wrestling holds, body worship, excessive lube/lotion, getting rimmed and species-play. I\\'m also partial to being a lazy dom, where the sub puts in most of the work (in character, obviously, post length and detail will not suffer if you enable this behavior... Unless you want it to). \\n\\nAs far as scenes go, the setting is very much up for negotiation. A simple modern world is a good default option but I\\'m open to sci-fi, fantasy and most everything if you can sell me on it being a good time. \\n\\nNow, what am I looking for from you? As I mentioned, I have standards that I\\'d like to think are reasonable. I expect your English to be fluent, your grammar, spelling and punctuation are important, I might well ignore your post if you don\\'t take the time to make sure you\\'ve actually proof read it- First impressions are important. Impressions me! In terms of body type I\\'m into a whole heap of things, fat guys, fit guys, plump girls, girls with abs, guys with abs, twinks, shortstacks, the works. I\\'m not looking for femboys or anyone with hyper proportions, however. \\n\\nIf you can live up to these expectations then I can promise you all the steamy, sweaty fun you desire; Locker room tussles, sauna scuffles, affairs in the garage or deep space fun in the final frontier. Everything is on the table. \\n\\nPhew... This post is getting long, ain\\'t it? Let\\'s wrap things up. If you\\'ve actually read this far then you\\'re probably dying to get in touch (I know I would be). You can find me on Kik at \"CatbuttzInc\" where I\\'ll be eagerly awaiting your messages. When you do message me, drop your name, ref, age and a little bit about yourself as proof you\\'ve read this whole thing. I\\'m not expecting a novel, just enough to prove you\\'re a competent writer. \\n\\nHopefully this big ol\\' wall of text served its purpose and I\\'ll be hearing from you soon.\\nI\\'m lookin\\' forward to getting a leg over ya\\'! \\n\\n[Obligatory Ref To Catch Your Eye](https://i.imgur.com/IUctB0E.jpg)\\n\\n**NO HUMANS, NO POKEMON, NO FERALS. THANK YOU.**',\n",

He takes no salary and just earns Tesla stock as compensation.\\n\\nThey ship X amount of cars to hit quarterly targets which “prove” to investors that Tesla is growing at a certain rate.\\n\\nSimilarly, This is why when Tesla fixes a bad vehicle it’s shown as a “goodwill” repair instead of a warranty repair. Warranty repairs can fall under a liability so they will hurt stock prices since as they ship more defective vehicles with an average cost of $X,XXX for fixes, the warranty liability grows.

The hovering roadster is a bit harder to defend; but just talking on a podcast (which is the only reference I could find to that claim in ~5min of searching) shouldn't count as strongly as press releases, and tbf, if *any* company is going to make a hovering car it's gonna be the car company that works extremely close with a rocket company. \\n\\nAs always with people who aren't engineers who manage engineers his timeline is stupidly implausible, and I have a feeling that anytime he gets pushback the person pushing won't be around for much longer so his dumb timelines that he picks out of the ether are what's being communicated outside the company.\",\n",

Fascinating!\\n\\nyou're conflating safety with whether or not there is a market. \\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;Given Tesla doesn't have self-driving cars and they not even leading in the technology at this point - you just admitted it's a stupid idea. Thanks.\\n\\nagain, you're conflating whether or not it is safe with whether or not it makes good business sense. in it's current state, it is only viable as a small scale people mover. they're betting they will be able to automate the vehicles at some point. will they? I don't know. it's a stupid idea if they never have automated vehicles. unfortunately for the boring company, it's owned by Musk and has to use Teslas, which are behind the industry. Waymo would do a better job. \\n\\nI think I'm starting to see a pattern here. you don't like the idea so the idea that it's unsafe is inseparable from whether or not the concept is sound from a functional standpoint. these are two separate things. you think that my pointing out your safety misconceptions means I must therefore think that the concept is perfect or something. that is not true. \\n\\n&gt; Tunnels are not new though xD\\n\\nthe Loop system is more than just tunnels. it's a combination of tunnels and autonomous EVs. it's currently shitty and uninteresting because the vehicles aren't automated.  \\n\\n&gt;And if you ask any actual tunnel engineer, they might be able to give you about a dozen reasons as to why a one-lane tunnel is bad. For example, to be able to make repairs without having to shut everything down.\\n\\nmost metro systems would have to shut down or single-track in order to do repairs on a tunnel. maybe you think most metro systems are bad, so I don't want to assume your argument is nonsensical, but I'm betting you don't think metros are bad, so maybe you need to rethink your reasoning.  \\n\\n&gt;Tunnels also are bigger so firefighters can get in.\\n\\nthe Loop tunnels are actually more accessible to firefighters than most metro tunnels. they can just drive a pickup truck straight into the tunnel if they need. there is no 3rd rail to worry about either (which sometimes does not shut down properly and complicates evacuations). again, you're not even thinking about these things before you say them, so maybe you should sit back and ask yourself simple question or run though things in your head before repeating the criticisms you hear from the echo chamber.  underground stations are less accessible to fire fighters than above-ground (which is most of what Loop is trying for), road-deck is more accessible to fire fighting pickups than tracks, etc.. just think for a minute.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Heck some modern tunnels have a freaking maintenance tunnels big enough for firetrucks.\\n\\nthat's great, but that does not make the ones without such tunnels (most) a bad idea? this is a rhetorical question, obviously metros without fire-truck side tunnels are still useful and worth operating.\",\n",

They found that climate change associated temperature changes will likely be detectable around 2030 in the Eastern Pacific, four decades earlier than previously expected.\\n\\nAdditionally, the signal is projected to emerge earlier in the Eastern than in the Central Pacific, driven by the faster warming of this region and therefore a larger increase in rainfall. ENSO-related mitigation and adaption efforts, therefore, must consider the diversity in the response of each ENSO regime to greenhouse warming, they conclude.\\nhttps://phys.org/news/2022-11-climate-eastern-pacific-weather-patterns.html\\n\\nAs Levine summarized these results, \"Overall, we\\'re seeing a significant worldwide decline in sperm counts of over 50% in the past 46 years, a decline that has accelerated in recent years.\"\\n\\nWhile the current study did not examine the causes of sperm count declines, Levine pointed to recent research indicating that disturbances in the development of the reproductive tract during fetal life are linked to lifetime impairment of fertility and other markers of reproductive dysfunction.

In this context, “real” means that objects have definite properties independent of observation—an apple can be red even when no one is looking. “Local” means that objects can be influenced only by their surroundings and that any influence cannot travel faster than light. Investigations at the frontiers of quantum physics have found that these things cannot both be true. Instead the evidence shows that objects are not influenced solely by their surroundings, and they may also lack definite properties prior to measurement.\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/\\n\\nGut microbiomes of mouse pups are permanently altered when moms are fed a low-fiber diet while nursing\\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/12/221208114729.htm\\n\\nResearchers have linked the artificial sweetener aspartame to anxiety-like behavior in mice.

Our wastewater treatment plants remove variable amounts of these pollutants from our sewage, and for some drugs very little of them. As a consequence, drug pollution levels are rising in waterways across the UK and globally.

There are three main types of patents that are available to you when applying for a patent for your software:\\nhttps://arapackelaw.com/patents/softwaremobile-apps/how-long-do-software-patents-last/\\n\\nMaintenance fees\\n\\nPatents protect innovative ideas and software. However, they only last for so long, so the question becomes, how long do software patents last? To keep a patent active, a software developer must pay regular maintenance fees. The fees vary according to entity classification, and you must pay them three, seven, and eleven years after issuance. If you miss a payment, your patent will expire and become public domain.\\n\\nHow Long Then Will A Software Patent Last?\\n\\nPatents generally last twenty years or less. The length of time the patent is enforceable depends on the type of patent.\\n\\nA utility patent, for example, lasts twenty years after the date of filing, while a plant patent lasts fifteen years. Before June 8, 1995, design patents lasted seventeen years. Those filed before May 12, 2015 are still valid for fourteen years. During the term of the patent, the owner must pay maintenance fees.\\n\\nIn addition, patents can expire if the inventor fails to pay the necessary maintenance fees.\\nhttps://www.patentpc.com/blog/how-long-do-software-patents-last\\n\\nAround us now, there are millions grasping for tomorrow in Iran, in Ukraine, in Hong Kong, in Brazil.

Insulin affects how body cells take up and use the sugar glucose, so it has a fundamental influence on the amount of energy available to cells for growth, reproduction and repair. In the process, it also regulates the generation of potentially harmful free radicals and other oxidizing molecules that are byproducts of metabolism. Many researchers suspect that this is why caloric restriction diets, which keep insulin levels low, seem to extend life span in many species.\\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/ants-live-10-times-longer-by-altering-their-insulin-responses-20230110/\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease\\n\\nOriginal research\\n\\nAntibiotic use as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease across the ages: a population-based cohort study\\nhttps://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/03/gutjnl-2022-327845\\n\\ndoctor looks at your nails and what exactly it is they are looking for.

Some have argued that ADEs were formed through geologic processes, but the Kuikuro create enriched soil, known as eegepe, around their villages today with ash, food scraps, and controlled burns. Morgan J. Schmidt and Taylor Perron of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and their colleagues compared samples of ADEs collected from areas around Kuikuro villages and archaeological sites in Brazil’s Xingu River basin and found that they are both far less acidic than the surrounding soils, perhaps as a result of the addition of ash. The ADEs also contained higher levels of nutrients needed for growing crops.

In the context of now well-documented Russian interference in recent US elections, we examine whether Russia’s election interference and its perceived impact on American democracy damage foreign public opinion about the United States. The results of our survey experiment fielded in Japan suggest that information about successful Russian election interference—that is, interference that had an impact on the election outcome—reduces foreign citizens’ faith in the United States as an ally. This pattern most clearly manifests in reduced belief in the US capacity to defend Japan. Our study sheds light on the connections between the image of the United States, both as a trustworthy and effective state, and the foreign public’s attitudes toward US alliances, with theoretical and practical implications.\\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13540661221143214\\n\\nExisting gas detectors are bulky and slow, and require a trained operator.

This has major implications for ecosystems near the ocean’s coasts and the industries that depend on them, from fishing to tourism. Second, OMZs are a significant source of nitrous oxide, a major greenhouse gas.\\n\\nHer team’s successful projections are not just due to new and better models, though they are using the latest suite, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The key insight, Resplandy said, was understanding that the OMZ isn’t uniform but has layers “like an onion” that respond differently to rising greenhouse gases.\\nhttps://www.princeton.edu/news/2023/01/06/pacific-oceans-oxygen-starved-omz-growing-new-princeton-research-finds\\n\\nTwitter CEO Elon Musk promised last month that the site\\'s revamped $8/month verification system would no longer allow troublemakers to impersonate famous people and companies.\\n\\nTurns out he was wrong yet again. The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey Fowler was easily able to impersonate US senator Edward Markey with a verified Twitter account with the username @SenatorEdMarkey — a stunt he also pulled during the first disastrous launch of the feature.\\n\\nIn other words, Twitter is doing very little to despite Musk\\'s promises of manually authenticating \"all\" blue checkmark accounts back in November.\\nhttps://futurism.com/the-byte/impersonate-senator-twitter-verification\\n\\nOne of the most important things you can do is to understand how to most effectively counter disinformation.

Today, American CEOs earn 940 percent more than their counterparts did in 1978. A typical worker, on the other hand, only goes home with 12 percent more money than workers from 1978 did.\\n\\nAs a report by the Economic Policy Institute demonstrates, rising CEO pay does not reflect a change in the value of skills—it represents a shift in power. Over decades, American politics has undermined the bargaining power of workers by discouraging and obstructing self-organizing efforts, such as unionization.\\n\\nThe growing wealth of a minority at the expense of the majority means power is concentrated in the hands of a few people, mostly men.

We find that for brands that promise utilitarian (functional, instrumental, and useful) benefits, consumers are encouraged by visual designs perceived as more orderly and structured. This suggests marketers can capitalize on the power of perception to influence beliefs about brand performance, which ultimately influences product interest and choice.\\n\\nUtilitarian vs. Hedonic Brands\\n\\nAt the other end of the spectrum are brands, such as Pepsi, which promise benefits related to enjoyment, pleasure, and experiences—collectively referred to as hedonic benefits. In this case, marketers can benefit from using visual design properties that convey lack of structure.\\nhttps://www.newswise.com/articles/think-before-you-design-your-brand-s-logo-how-marketers-can-capitalize-on-the-power-of-perception-to-influence-beliefs-about-brand-performance\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nIn the HFCS group, there was a significant difference between the time to find the platform in the MWM test and time spent in the quadrant between days 1 and 5 (P=0.037 and P=0.001, respectively). In addition, a decreased level of MT1A receptor, TNF-α, iNOS, osteopontin (OPN), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions were significantly increased in the HFCS group. Melatonin treatment reversed MT1A receptor levels and TNF-α, iNOS, OPN, and IL-6 expressions. During the histopathological examination, increased neuronal degenerations were observed in the HFCS group. Melatonin ameliorated these changes.\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9790051/\\n\\nTo most people trying to make a living, pay bills, or fight an illness, spending time considering that our reality is not the “real thing” but actually a highly sophisticated simulation sounds ridiculous. “I wish smart people would focus on real-world problems instead of this nonsense,” someone close to me recently told me. Despite being a scientist that uses computer simulations on my research, I sympathize with this. It’s way too convenient to blame our current mess on powers beyond our control.

With a groan, Catherine rolls to her side and rushes to turn off the alarm and sits up. The wide by short statures female fox turns back to face a sleeping form in her bed and leans over to them. “Sorry, I forgot to reset my alarm. You can go back to bed, I’ll make us some breakfast.” She whispers in their ear and rises to her feet with a loud groan.\\n\\nHer shape in the dim morning light revealed that Catherine was expecting a healthy litter of children to be born nearly any day based on the size of her overweight stomach. Her heavy breasts in her bra were leaking as a clear sign of motherhood soon arriving as well. Despite this amazing event that was bound to happen in the next few days it seemed, she was more than willing to still support her mate(s) with preparing them meals and keeping their home as clear as she could.\\n\\nStruggling to find something to wear, the violet haired doe slips on a robe over her underwear and slowly slips out into the living room to make her way to the kitchen. With each step she could almost hear her heavy breasts audibly slosh with milk, ready to feed an army and keeping her appetite full of desire to eat more and anything she could get her hands on. That wouldn’t be any different this morning as she began to cook a healthy breakfast of bacon, eggs, sausage, biscuits, and sausage patties.\\n\\nPrep for this morning feast was nearly complete by the time she also finished partially milking her heavy breasts into several more bottles. She had already produced enough motherly milk to fill a large shelf of bottles full of her breast milk in anticipation of how many kids she could be carrying. Bent over the countertops making coffee as the last thing to cook, she suddenly felt hands gripping her wide hips and sliding across her large pregnant figure. \\n\\nHow was her mate going to reward her for helping them prepare for the day ahead?~ She couldn’t wait to see how much of a mess they might make her even if she was expecting so many pups soon!\\n\\nGood morning, my name is Catherine and I am on the hunt for roleplaying partners interested in helping this pregnant mother in her final days of her pregnancy. Are the pups yours? Are you replacing them with your own? Maybe you’re filling this brood mother with more eggs by the day? I would love to hear your ideas and discuss any questions you might have!

       "  'selftext': \"(Having Discord gets you first in line)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA rather well-known family lived in the small town of Rio. This family was the Gildings. The Gildings were noble people that used their wealth to help the small town grow into a settlement that stood the test of time. To make sure the noble family could keep an eye on the town, they built a manor atop the largest hill, where their family could live and look over the settlement. Over the years, the Gildings looked out for the small town until the family slowly started to wither away. This was mostly due to disease that swept through the land or the rare instance of one of the family members being murdered. This fact sadly meant that the Gildings, a family name that lasted nearly ten generations, only had a single person to carry on the name. That person was Rebecca Gilding.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nRebecca was a rather shy and timid girl as she grew up, always wanting to be alone. This only intensified after a horse-riding accident, which broke the girl's leg and caused it to sadly never heal properly. This made Rebecca rely on a cane whenever she needed to walk, which still caused her great pain and caused her to become even more isolated in her daily life. It got to the point where maids would constantly remind the young woman to eat for fear she would wither away as well.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter the death of Rebecca's parents, the young heir was left all alone. The only people she had for company were her maids and the people of Rio. Rebecca's maids came in many different ages, sizes, and species. The Gildings didn't discriminate based on a person's species, which made the sight of monster girls wearing maid dresses a normal affair. It was common to see a lamia watering the plants, a centaur making sure the family steed was taken care of, and a goblin picking up groceries.

Due to this injury she started to spend more and more time in her room, sometimes needing to be fed by the maids to make sure the girl didn't die of dehydration or starvations. Ever since her parents died, she seemed to have gotten even more reclusive and barely comes out, however when she does it's only to get drunk and pass out in a stupor. This is because she feels like she'll die alone paired with already low self-esteem.

You also have no limit in amount of characters you can play, so you can play 1, 3, or even 5 characters if you feel like it. Maybe you play a grandma like centaur that tries to raise the young woman's self-esteem? Or maybe you play the Orc barkeep that's getting worried by how much Rebecca comes in and gets drunk?

       "  'selftext': \"(Having Discord gets you first in line)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA rather well-known family lived in the small town of Rio. This family was the Gildings. The Gildings were noble people that used their wealth to help the small town grow into a settlement that stood the test of time. To make sure the noble family could keep an eye on the town, they built a manor atop the largest hill, where their family could live and look over the settlement. Over the years, the Gildings looked out for the small town until the family slowly started to wither away. This was mostly due to disease that swept through the land or the rare instance of one of the family members being murdered. This fact sadly meant that the Gildings, a family name that lasted nearly ten generations, only had a single person to carry on the name. That person was Rebecca Gilding.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nRebecca was a rather shy and timid girl as she grew up, always wanting to be alone. This only intensified after a horse-riding accident, which broke the girl's leg and caused it to sadly never heal properly. This made Rebecca rely on a cane whenever she needed to walk, which still caused her great pain and caused her to become even more isolated in her daily life. It got to the point where maids would constantly remind the young woman to eat for fear she would wither away as well.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter the death of Rebecca's parents, the young heir was left all alone. The only people she had for company were her maids and the people of Rio. Rebecca's maids came in many different ages, sizes, and species. The Gildings didn't discriminate based on a person's species, which made the sight of monster girls wearing maid dresses a normal affair. It was common to see a lamia watering the plants, a centaur making sure the family steed was taken care of, and a goblin picking up groceries. This was also true for the town of Rio, which became a haven for monsters.

       "  'body': 'Soon! But I believe it will get a lot worse first. Though, it\\'s getting worse pretty fast right now!  \\n\\n\\nI go back to this verse a lot lately... thinking about what it was like in Noah\\'s time.  \\n\\n\\nMatthew 24:37 - 38  \\n\"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark.…\"  \\n\\n\\nMuch of this is my opinion. But, I look at this verse a whole and consider the following about \"the days of Noah\". Here is what I understand it was like:  \\n\\n\\n1. Earth population had exploded! Many estimates are well over 120b people existed before the flood. 12 times what we have today!\\n2. Massive technological advancement. A lot of people think this wasn\\'t the case based solely on the tech used to build the ark. But remember, we don\\'t know all of the reasons God told Noah to build it the way he did. Maybe it was because God didn\\'t want remnants of the old world tech to survive? Maybe it was what Noah simply had access to? Remember God commonly used the \"humble\" things all throughout the Bible for various reasons. Does it seem in the character of God to tell Noah to go become an elon musk with all the modern technology at his fingertips and build the most advanced ark he could? Or, start cutting down gopher wood while the world makes fun of you and build that ark with more conventional / humble means? Also bear in mind that due mainly to the flood, we are a petroleum based society. Absolutely everything you use today is built with or constructed literally of petroleum products, from the monitor and keyboard you\\'re using right now, to likely much of the clothing you\\'re wearing, your car you drive, etc. etc. These petro reserves were made possible by the flood. What did advanced tech look like prior to the flood? I have no idea. But if people were technologically advanced, it was in much different ways than we think of it today.\\n3. Long age: Peopled lived hundreds of years old. Imagine how bad someone like, I don\\'t know a Hitler could be if they could play the long game and knew the would live to be multiple centuries old if they were careful! Now compare that to today, the life-expectancy is longer than ever ( minus the short down-turn from covid). Every rich person in the world (aside from Musk apparently because he\\' thinks it\\'s a kinda evil obsession) is researching tech to extend their life and or transfer their consciousness in a way that makes them live forever. Billions upon billions of dollars, more money and power than ever before being dumped into medical advancement in this area. I predict in the coming decades, you will start to see rich people outlive the rest of us due to their access to very advanced medical procedures that cost hundreds of millions.\\n4. Fallen angels, demons, and cult practices all over the earth. Remember the Nephilim? Somehow demons / angels were able to enter the earth in human form, inter-breed with human females and created the Nephilim or \"men of power\" or \"men of renoun\". Some of their genetics survived the flood. Remember the area of \"Gath\" (where Goliath and other giants were from). These were NOT like giants we have in the 20th/21st century - unhealthy people - but rather extremely healthy, powerful, warriors. They were not so much deformities as they were genetically different people, influenced physically by the supernatural beings fallen from heaven.',\n",

We clashed into the evening, and when the sun fell behind the horizon and the party was heading upstairs to sleep, we found yet another reason to bicker - due to the number of available rooms, we had to share the same bed. It wasn't even a double!\\n\\nOnce we were inside, I couldn't remember touching you, or even saying anything, and all I could hear was the deep thumping of my heart. And then, suddenly, your hands were on my body, and mine on yours...\\n\\nI'm bisexual so your character is free to be any sex and gender of your choosing, though I should mention I'm not too attracted to overly masculine men. Additionally, I'd like to set a boundary: Please leave IRL details out of this RP. I'm not interested in knowing what you look like in real life, your name, etc. Thanks!\\n\\nKinks: Size difference, dom/sub, rough sex, futanari, large cocks and balls, squirting, hentai logic, excessive cum, anal, oral, kissing, sloppy oral, creampies, breeding, rimming, sweat, musk, free use, public / semi-public, groping, humiliation, degradation, outercourse, romance, unusual / varied positions, tummies, thighs, biting, interracial, long drawn-out sex scenes and make out sessions. None of these kinks are totally necessary!\\n\\nLimits: Feet, me in the dominant position, vomit, blood, urine, scat, pregnancy, violence, unhygienic bodies, choking, gore, death.\\n\\nInterested in this prompt? Great! Make sure to do the following:\\n\\nSend me a PM with your kinks, limits, character details (ref pics are appreciated!), and any other ideas you have for this RP.\\n\\nI only use Reddit PMs to RP. Any chat requests or propositions to use another platform will be declined. I'll provide a reference image for my character in PMs. Opening messages that are short, off-topic, or generally lack content will be ignored.

       "  'body': \"&gt;\\tIn Silicon Valley, the new year began as the last one ended — with tens of thousands of tech workers losing their jobs. Just a few days into 2023, Amazon Chief Executive Andrew Jassy announced that there would be 18,000 layoffs across the company. Within weeks, Microsoft revealed it was slashing its head count by 10,000 and Google said that it was terminating 12,000 employees. IBM looks to be next, with nearly 4,000 workers on the chopping block.\\n\\n&gt;This follows 2022’s bloodbath, when tens of thousands of jobs were lost at Meta Platforms, Twitter and Salesforce. According to an industry layoff tracker, the tech sector has eliminated some 220,000 jobs since the start of last year. If the laid-off tech workers formed a city, it’d be one of the most populous in the United States, bigger than Des Moines or Salt Lake City.\\n\\n&gt;The question is: Why have many of the most profitable companies of our generation — most of which are still very much profitable — announced staggering rounds of layoffs, one after the other? And why now?\\n\\n&gt;A common refrain from analysts and reporters is that the companies are “tightening their belts” after profligate pandemic hiring sprees, in order to streamline operations. The executives overseeing the cuts, for their part, cite adverse economic circumstances. “We hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in his layoff announcement. Jassy wrote that “Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so.” Microsoft’s Satya Nadella noted that “some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one.”\\n\\n&gt;No recession has yet hit the U.S. or its tech sector. Inflation hurts, but the U.S. economy added hundreds of thousands of jobs last month. Still, certain shareholders have been vocal about their desire to see head counts trimmed — and trimmed further still.\\n\\n&gt;To that end, critics argue that simple greed is driving the layoffs; they point to the tens of billions’ worth of stock buybacks the tech companies authorized last year. The Verge’s Liz Lopatto spoke with industry analysts who said that tech companies are evaluating their bottom lines differently, and concluded that they’re doing layoffs mostly because everyone else is, even though layoffs actually often cost a given company money. And the fact all these layoffs are happening in such rapid succession gives the companies some cover — making them seem elemental, inevitable.\\n\\n&gt;\\tCompany bikes sit outside an office building on Google's Mountain View campus.\\nTECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET\\n\\n\\n&gt;So what’s really going on here? The answer may actually be pretty simple.\\n\\n&gt;“Controlling labor costs via periodic layoffs is like breathing for Silicon Valley: cyclical, necessary for life,” Malcolm Harris, author of the forthcoming book “Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism and the World,” told me. The layoffs, Harris says, have “very little to do with long- or even medium-term strategy except as it pertains to cultivating an insecure workforce.”\\n\\n&gt;That tracks with the economic reality we do face today, as a tech CEO might put it. Because while a recession has not yet arrived in any meaningful form, there is another economic indicator pointing to the desirability of layoffs, from a large employer’s perspective: a growing effort to organize tech workers in an unusually tight labor market.\\n\\n&gt;Tech employees’ salaries have skyrocketed over the last two years, and their bargaining power has begun to grow too. Over the last half-decade, workers in the tech industry have agitated for changes that executives have found increasingly inconvenient.\\n\\n&gt;At Google, they’ve spoken up against gender inequalities and pressured the company to drop a lucrative defense contract. At Amazon and Microsoft, they’ve protested lackluster climate policies and spurred those companies to make pledges to reduce carbon emissions. At Facebook and Twitter, workers rallied against content moderation decisions around keeping former President Trump on the platform after Jan. 6, 2021. A subset of Google employees formed the Alphabet Workers Union with the Communication Workers of America union, Amazonians founded the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, and at Microsoft, employees at a video game subsidiary, ZeniMax, formed the first certified union ever to be recognized by the company.\\n\\n&gt;The concrete gains won by organizing tech workers so far may be relatively small, but the rising salaries and growing organizing capacity threaten the tech giants’ bottom line and the brand of executive sovereignty that’s prized in Silicon Valley. Elon Musk’s mass firings at Twitter last year, and his public demand that only “hardcore” coders dedicated to his program remain at the company, are instructive here, not least because other tech executives have said his approach was an inspiration when culling jobs at their own companies.\\n\\n&gt;\\tTwitter headquarters is shown in San Francisco, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022. Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter after a protracted legal battle and months of uncertainty. The question now is what the billionaire Tesla CEO will actually do with the social media platform.(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\\nBUSINESS\\n\\n&gt;Workers in an industry that had long been famously union-agnostic at best had been forming bonds, organizing and developing solidarity. Layoffs of this scale and suddenness can be a blow to that process.\\n\\n&gt;Affected tech workers told me that they were struck by the randomness of the firings; senior members of staff in good standing, brilliant colleagues with sterling performance reviews, all shown the door, with little rhyme or reason. Many seemed to wonder why they were spared while their peers weren’t.\\n\\n&gt;Alejandra Beatty, a technical program manager at Alphabet subsidiary Verily, told me it was “very much a surprise” when she was laid off this month. For one thing, she had known herself to be in good standing at the company. “I was high performance, considered one of the pillars of the local community in the Boulder, Colo., office. Now I’m not even allowed to go back in, not even as a visitor,” she said. Beatty was also struck by how many of those let go were performing functions crucial to keeping “core products” working.\\n\\n&gt;If there’s one thing that firing people in a large-scale and seemingly random way accomplishes, it’s instilling a sense of precarity, even fear, in those who remain.\\n\\n&gt;“It’s completely devastating,” said Skylar Hinnant, a senior quality assurance tester at Microsoft’s ZeniMax subsidiary, “both to the people who are laid off and their families, and their colleagues, who felt, for that day and will feel it a long time after, that they’re at risk.”\\n\\n&gt;Hinnant said he knew plenty of people who lost their jobs across Microsoft — everyone does. “You can be the most important engineer at your job, you can be an awesome programmer, at the end of the day if the algorithm wants you gone you’re gone.”\\n\\n&gt;\\tIn this Sept. 24, 2019, file photo, a woman walks below a Google sign on the campus in Mountain View, Calif. Google is in the crosshairs of U.S. antitrust regulators who accuse it of wrongdoing similar to charges Microsoft faced 22 years ago, when Google was starting out in a Silicon Valley garage. How Google grew from its idealistic roots into what regulators describe as a cutthroat behemoth is a story shaped by unbridled ambition, savvy decision making, technology’s networking effects, lax regulatory oversight and the pressure to pump up profits. (\\n\\n&gt;“I think it’s waking people up to some realities of what the industry is really like,” Alejandra Beatty said. “We are workers. Even though we have benefits and we are highly trained — we’re still workers. We can still arbitrarily lose our jobs like anyone else.”\\n\\n&gt;Beatty had been a visible member of the AWU, advocating in media interviews for reproductive rights in the workplace. She was always civil and constructive, she says, and felt her suggestions had been well-received by management. Now she thinks a lot about whether her termination was retaliatory. Ultimately, she decided the layoffs were too large, too automated to have targeted her directly. “I think I was yet another number in whatever crazy algorithm the consulting company used to figure out the cuts,” she said.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '[原文链接](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-64291203)\\n\\n**一个新的太空秩序正在形成，那就是美国和中国的太空竞赛。不过就巨大的太空探索需求而言，即使是超级大国也无法独立完成所有的太空任务。**\\n\\n太空行动往往被形容为充满技术挑战并且耗资巨大，更不用说把人类送到地球以外的地方去工作和生活的目标 -- 可能就在今后10年之内。再考虑到我们生活在一个分裂的世界，很少有同心协力的国际努力，那么，这样宏大的太空目标现实吗？\\n\\n美国宇航局已经开始了阿耳忒弥斯（Artemis）重返月球的计划。计划中的3次发射第一次已经获得成功。这次不载人的太空飞行对火箭和登月技术进行了测试。第二次的载人发射将把人类带到之前从未到达过的太空深处。第三次发射将把宇航员送上月球、让他们在月球逗留一星期，进行各种实验。登月计划的长期目标是把月球当作飞往火星的跳板。\\n\\n登月计划预计耗资930亿美元，对美国纳税人来说是一项巨大的投入，特别是当美国经济面临紧缩的时候更是如此。\\n\\n去年美国审计署在提交给国会的报告中对一项“不现实的发展计划”提出警告，说它可能会超支，并且说美国宇航局需要让开支估计变得“更可靠，更透明”。\\n\\n虽然美国宇航局得到的预算总体上少于他们要求2023年得到的预算额，但是美国国会目前仍然支持载人太空探索计划。\\n\\n中国的天宫号太空站已经在地球轨道进入全部运营阶段。中国已经开始了月球和火星探测的太空计划并且进行了飞船发射。中国计划在2025年前在月球建立一个无人研究基地，然后在2030年之前把宇航员送上月球。\\n\\n把宇航员送上月球之前已经实现，但是下一步的目标是要把人送上火星，这个任务的难度就要大得多。去火星的距离是去月球距离的250倍，目前还没有任何火箭有能力把宇航员送到火星这个红色星球。\\n\\n即使科学家找到了发射携带大量液体燃料火箭的安全途径，但是火星大气稀薄，在上面降落，以及如何让宇航员经过多个月的太空飞行安全返回地球都是巨大的挑战。\\n\\n过去超级大国在外层空间展开竞赛。美国和苏联在1959和1960年代都努力争夺太空主宰。俄罗斯首先将人送入地球轨道，美国在几年后第一次把人送上月球。\\n\\n1970年代迎来了合作的黄金时代，太空合作的高峰就是在1998年发射进入地球轨道的国际空间站。\\n\\n美国，俄罗斯同其他13个伙伴国家合作建立的国际空间站现在仍是太空最大的人造结构。空间站不属于任何国家，但每个国家都要靠同其他国家的合作才能操作空间站。\\n\\n空间站代表着如果国家能搁置分歧共同合作，人类能取得的共同成就。\\n\\n但是现实往往和理想有差距，尤其是美国阻止中国成为国际空间站的伙伴国，因此中国开始建造自己的空间站。\\n\\n不久前，在俄乌战争开始的两周内，许多国家停止了同俄罗斯的合作。欧洲太空局(ESA)同俄罗斯的两次联合探月行动被取消，寻找火星生命痕迹的火星表面探测器项目也被叫停。\\n\\n但细究起来国际空间站的合作还在继续，西方国家同俄罗斯合作维持空间站在轨道上继续运行。美国人和欧洲人仍然在莫斯科郊外的俄罗斯星城培训中心接受训练。\\n\\n国际空间站在2030年使用寿命到期的时候会发生什么呢？\\n\\n英国皇家联合军种研究所（RUSI）军事科学团队空间安全政策研究人员朱丽安娜·绥斯（Juliana Suess）说：现在俄罗斯能够对伙伴国家提供的帮助已经没有过去那么多，他们的技术已经过时。她提到，（俄罗斯）这个第一个进入太空的国家可能成为第一个退出太空的国家。\\n\\n她说，“如果俄罗斯人在国际空间站寿命结束的时候没有找到替代办法，研发自己的空间站，而且就目前看实现上述目标的可能性不大，俄罗斯可能就不会再有载人太空飞行。”\\n\\n在俄罗斯面临困难的时候，中国的太空项目正取得迅猛发展。在过去10年当中，中国已经进行了200多次火箭发射，但就太空开支来说，中国还是无法同美国的太空投入相比。\\n\\n中国很重视伙伴关系能带来技术和资金。中国邀请那些被禁止参加国际空间站项目的国家参加中国的太空项目，并征集科学实验的建议。\\n\\n## 亿万富翁的太空投资\\n\\n太空是我们日常生活的重要组成部分。\\n\\n我们依赖卫星做天气预报，通讯，银行转账，更不用说国家用卫星进行侦察活动。地球上面的卫星正在变得越来越多，而且越来越繁忙地运作。在2021年就有约5千颗卫星被发射进入太空。而在20年前，每年发射的卫星约有800个左右。\\n\\n太空项目耗资巨大，而且技术上充满了挑战，没有一个国家能够独自完成这种艰巨任务。这就需要建立新的伙伴合作关系，这时候新涌现出的亿万富翁就变得十分重要。\\n\\n马斯克（Elon Musk）的公司SpaceX已经把太空旅客送入地球轨道。这位亿万富豪企业家通过重复使用火箭降低了发射成本。亚马逊的老板杰弗里·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）也不甘落后，也想建造一个商用的轨道太空站，该太空站被起名为“轨道礁”（Orbital Reef）。\\n\\n海伦·沙曼（Helen Sharman）是英国第一个宇航员，她曾经在1991年登上苏联的和平号太空站。她认为私营企业的务实精神会让目前的国际太空竞争相形见绌。\\n\\n她对BBC记者说，“商业化会把全世界的公司联合在一起。我们不在乎他们在哪里注册，重要的是他们能成就什么，给世界带来什么益处。”\\n\\n可能取得经济收益和科学发现的前景促进了多方合作。私营公司可能带来新的太空合作，因为他们必须要付出自己国家的法律。当一些国家在2022年开始对俄罗斯实行制裁的时候，商业公司也被迫同俄罗斯脱钩。\\n\\n欧洲太空局局长阿施巴赫（Josef Aschbacher）博士希望欧洲能继续保留在新的太空竞赛中。虽然各国政府都在紧缩开支，但欧洲太空局最近得到增加的20亿英镑的拨款。\\n\\n阿施巴赫博士对BBC记者说，“太空是扩展迅速的一个领域，在过去几十年当中变化更快。我们不能输掉这场竞赛。我们需要做的是全力加入，因为我希望对参与国家的公司有更多商业技术。”\\n\\n未来太空探索的主要角色还是国家。但是为了应对挑战，这些国家会联合成一个单个的集团，互相分享信息，同其他集团进行竞争。多年来欧洲太空局一直在这么做。\\n\\n## 太空的新法律\\n\\n不过可能阻止向天外探索的潜在障碍是关于太空的一系列国际法律规定。1967年签订的“外太空条约”一直没有被更新过，当时有包括苏联和美国在内的31个国家都签署了这个条约，他们承诺不会把核武器带入太空。\\n\\n据英国皇家联合军种研究所的朱丽安娜·绥斯说，这个条约已经不合时宜。\\n\\n她说，“条约没有涉及公司；没有涉及亿万富翁。现在的太空已经和1967年的太空完全不同。”\\n\\n联合国在1979年提出的新规则为商业探索和利用月球，火星和更远的天体制定了规则，但是美国，中国和俄罗斯都拒绝签署该文件。\\n\\n欧洲太空局局长阿施巴赫博士认为，在新的外太空条约确立前，新的太空竞赛会受到制约。\\n\\n他说，“在太空我们的卫星使用同样的轨道，中国，美国，欧洲都利用同一块的月球表面。我们需要合作确立接触规则，建立如何在外太空工作的规则。”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Legacy technology can be lucrative if you\\'re in the right place at the the right time to work on it, take the FAA\\'s failure of their NOTAM system earlier this month.  That probably runs on 80s or maybe even 70s technology, the number of people that know how to administrate it and properly maintain it are probably few indeed.  That gives them a lot of job security since it seems upgrade of the system is stuck in a bureaucratic sinkhole. \\n\\nMy read on the recent layoffs is that many being let go were on H1B-visas, as such they were regarded as \"temporary workers\" by their sponsoring companies even though many had been with those companies for 10+ years.  Others are likely middle managers that were identified as not providing much value during the Pandemic.  Elon Musk may be a tool and his methods leave much to be desire but Twitter was top-heavy as a corporation and a housecleaning was needed.  Now that companies can no longer borrow money for free a lot of other industry leaders probably feel the same.    \\n\\nIn at least three cases of recent high profile layoffs (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) the companies are hiring like crazy because they all just split a [$9B cloud contract from DOD.](https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-amazoncom-inc-cloud-computing-us-department-of-defense-bfaeb3549b4d42328f35e579d7cb40b0)  To fulfill that contract those companies will need new workers that are US nationals, probably with security clearances.  So there are always going to be cases of large companies hiring in one area, RIFing in another.  There\\'s also a lot of hiring going on in other companies as well, simply because it\\'s January and new budgets and new projects for the new year are just being announced.  These stories don\\'t make the news because they\\'re not sensational, they\\'re part of the regular business cycle.\\n\\nOverall unemployment for the US is still very low, though it is projected to rise slightly over the next few months.  As for starting a career in technology, I would say there is no better time than now.  There are more cheap or even free educational resources available than ever before, such that a dedicated and focused person can teach themselves the skills necessary to make a top 20% US salary in four to five years, no college required.  Maybe it\\'s a reflection of my generation but that\\'s still remarkable to me.  All I ever heard from my parents growing up is that if I didn\\'t go to college I would be a failure.  That\\'s just not true any longer, demonstrably so.  Technology is what drives our economy and those that are working in it may have hiccups in their careers as the industry thrives or doesn\\'t but they\\'ll always have options, especially if they\\'re willing to learn new knowledge and skills.',\n",

It didn\\'t seem that way at first — didn\\'t seem like a lie. I was just taking the easy path, keeping my parents happy, as any dutiful daughter should. Avoid conflict. Avoid confrontation. Avoid drama. And it was working.\\n \\nI just didn\\'t realise that I was losing myself in the process.\\n \\nWith my friends, I could be a little more myself. They were my safe haven, a little carved-out refuge in a swirling sea of fear and distrust, all of us outcasts, conforming with our non-conformity. But even that became a performance. We\\'d sit around in deep discussion about the wrongs of the world, pontificating on some topic or other, quoting philosophers or authors anywhere we could as it was easier than having ideas of our own.\\n \\nI\\'d say something like \"More people should see that history is nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes.\" and someone else would counter with \"Ah, but it is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.\" Then, we\\'d all nod wisely, sipping drinks we didn\\'t really like and congratulating ourselves on escaping the chains of society by living on its outskirts like it was something we\\'d chosen for ourselves.\\n \\nScott only managed to convince us to come to the club by claiming it would be ironic.\\n \\nOf course, we clung to the walls at first, used to life on the fringes.\\n \\nThe music was loud. The air was thick with the musk of sweat and booze and smoke. The floor was sticky and the lights hurt my eyes. I hated it.\\n \\nUntil I saw you.\\n \\nYou were in the middle of the dance floor. Of course you were. You were spinning around with your arms outstretched and head tilted back, hair flowing and swaying around you, shimmering in all the colours of the rainbow under the electric lights. Your eyes were closed and your face was painted in an expression of pure joy.\\n \\nI couldn\\'t help but smile just to look at you.\\n \\nAnd when you looked at me, eyes twinkling, I thought my heart had stopped.\\n \\nSuddenly, the music wasn\\'t too loud. It filled my world, surging through my soul. The lights weren\\'t glaring — on you, they were beautiful. The air was thick with the scent of life, and when you beckoned, I braved the stickiness of the dancefloor.\\n \\nConversation was impossible. Anything more than a single word shouted in an ear was lost to the beat. But we didn\\'t need words.\\n \\nIt was the freest I\\'d ever felt, letting myself go as I swayed and spun and shimmied.\\n \\nAnd when you took my hands in yours, the electricity in the atmosphere and the music and the lights surged through my veins. Then, as you drew me closer, that tingle of static grew to the roar of lightning until our lips met and...\\n \\nIt might have been a cliché that would have made me and my friends roll our eyes and groan, but when we kissed, sparks flew. The tickle of your breath. The heat of your skin against mine. The taste of your coconut lip balm.\\n \\nI thought my chest would burst with the joy bubbling inside.\\n \\nFrom that moment on, my grin refused to fade, no matter how much my face ached. I stared into your eyes as we boogied the night away.\\n \\nDisco has held a special place in my heart ever since, as have you. To be so truly yourself — so free of fear or worry or shame. To be proud of who you are. To simply let go. People are embarrassed by it, but I love it.\\n \\nPerhaps our story could have had a different ending. If I\\'d clung to your hand when the music finally stopped. If I\\'d followed you back into the real world. If I\\'d ever learnt your name. But perhaps that night was everything I needed it to be, and anything more would have just been greedy.\\n \\nSo, whoever you were, wherever you are now, thank you. Thank you for that one perfect night. Thank you for helping me find myself. Thank you for helping me be free.',\n",

Despite this amazing event that was bound to happen in the next few days it seemed, she was more than willing to still support her mate(s) with preparing them meals and keeping their home as clear as she could.\\n\\nStruggling to find something to wear, the violet haired doe slips on a robe over her underwear and slowly slips out into the living room to make her way to the kitchen. With each step she could almost hear her heavy breasts audibly slosh with milk, ready to feed an army and keeping her appetite full of desire to eat more and anything she could get her hands on. That wouldn’t be any different this morning as she began to cook a healthy breakfast of bacon, eggs, sausage, biscuits, and sausage patties.\\n\\nPrep for this morning feast was nearly complete by the time she also finished partially milking her heavy breasts into several more bottles. She had already produced enough motherly milk to fill a large shelf of bottles full of her breast milk in anticipation of how many kids she could be carrying. Bent over the countertops making coffee as the last thing to cook, she suddenly felt hands gripping her wide hips and sliding across her large pregnant figure. \\n\\nHow was her mate going to reward her for helping them prepare for the day ahead?~ She couldn’t wait to see how much of a mess they might make her even if she was expecting so many pups soon!\\n\\nGood morning, my name is Catherine and I am on the hunt for roleplaying partners interested in helping this pregnant mother in her final days of her pregnancy. Are the pups yours? Are you replacing them with your own? Maybe you’re filling this brood mother with more eggs by the day? I would love to hear your ideas and discuss any questions you might have!

       "  'body': '&gt; cancel culture literally ruins peoples lifes.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t. Cancel culture isn\\'t a thing. It\\'s just another issue made up to be outraged about by outrage peddlers. Yes, some people get falsely accused of things and it sticks with them but it\\'s not something that happens so often as to need a new term for that. These issues can be discussed without using the term cancel culture. People\\'s lives were ruined before the term became the latest right wing rallying cry and it will keep happening. \\n\\nPeople talk more about cancel culture than it actually happens. Most of it is about people in positions of prominence/power who can\\'t stand that somebody\\'s making fun of them on twitter. Just look at Musk\\'s… well everything in the last months. In times past when regular plebs didn\\'t have access to them they didn\\'t have to deal with people correcting their bullshit and they could happily live in ignorance of how many people think they are as dumb as a sack of bricks. \\n\\nSo no, I won\\'t be having with you on the one hand using that term like that while on the other hand asking for restraint on this topic. Chose one consistent way to act about all of this.\\n\\nThe reason cancel culture (as a term) is a thing these days is because conservatives and liberals hated what the term \"to cancel somebody\" initially meant. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture#Etymology\\n\\nIt was simply a term of empowerment for those who have no/little power in a certain dynamic. That was before it became \"a thing\" and it gets used like you tried to do. If you cancel somebody then you don\\'t pay them any attention. It was unilateral because you had no other power over them. You ignore them. A one person boycott. That\\'s it. Jut a personal \"I\\'m done with this bullshit, I got better things to do\".\\n\\nBut Fox News, the New York Times, and every other big media entity that was losing viewers to the internet where people were not limited by traditional media couldn\\'t handle that. So the moment they picked up the latest AAVE term to redefine (after woke) they constructed a new narrative around it. And it made it possible to disempower people while also wielding the term as cudgel against most criticism.\\n\\nSo no, I won\\'t be entertaining your usage of the term. If you want this discussion to be polite, more reserved, and all that then use the term false accusations or anything else that actually fits the context instead of using of modern outrage culture\\'s hype terms. \\n\\n&gt; i dont trust reddit/twitter/the internet in general to make that decision on someone. i would rather listen to courts, thanks.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying you have to listen to reddit or twitter (please don\\'t listen to any site uncritically) but people will share their opinion on such issues on social media. It\\'s simply a fact that whatever gets said here won\\'t affect these trials one way or another. This appeal to \"innocent until proven guilty\" is nice and idealistic but it would also mean you\\'d have zero discussions about any court case ever. \\n\\n\"Innocent until proven guilty\" means that courts won\\'t condemn you to punishment without showing enough evidence of wrongdoing (or at least they should be trying to do this). And there also have been cases where people were clearly not innocent but where the proof was simply not strong enough to convict them. In the same way that innocent people can end up in prison so can guilty people end up free.\\n\\nWe as a society have decided that we\\'d rather have free guilty people than convicted innocent people. Philosophers and lawyers have good arguments for why we want to do things this way. That\\'s the ideal but it doesn\\'t work out like that: Money can buy quite a bit of innocence and the lack thereof can condemn you to unjust punishment due to the procedures of our system of law enforcment.\\n\\nBut that\\'s also simply not how reddit works. People are talking about this trial because it\\'s somewhat on topic (or of interest?) here. It\\'s gossip. We don\\'t have all the evidence in front of us, we are not trained to evaluate it or to argue law, and out opinions won\\'t put Alves behind bars. That\\'s why appealing for \"innocent until proven guilty\" in this type of discussion is futile.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a standard that works within this type of discussion. People are voicing their opinion, not appealing to the rest of us to overthrow the courts and put him behind bars without a trial just because they assume (in the context of this conversation) that Alves is guilty when they make their comments. In the end, people here are just gossiping about a topic.',\n",

       "  'body': \"&gt;In end of life scenarios how the survivors feel takes a back seat to how the person literally dying feels. He's not ignoring it at all, he's wholly embracing it and trying to make his last day with him a good memory. Isn't staying alive, deteriorating into someone who can't function for themselves in even the most basic ways, and forcing Bill to become a full time caretaker in every way imaginable a lot more cruel?\\n\\nIn end of life scenarios, the dying party doesn’t usually drop their wish to die on the partner/family the day before. It’s something that’s discussed and planned. If your partner had cancer and then one day out of the blue they said “I want today to be my last day and if yo using do this for me you don’t love me”, you wouldn’t have an issue with that?\\n\\n&gt;That's reality! We can't escape it, we can't gloss over death and make it easier for the people it hurts, it's a struggle! It's supposed to be hard! He doesn't expect him to be fine at all, it's very blatantly obvious that it was a painful and difficult thing for him to ask. But that is love my dude, who else are you supposed to ask that of and put through that if not the person you are in love with who loves you back?\\n\\nOnce again, I’m not denying the reality of the situation. I’m saying it’s a dick move for Frank to drop this suddenly on Bill, and when Bill is struggling to accept it, Frank basically gaslights him by saying if you don’t do this then you don’t love me. \\n\\n&gt;I actually find it kinda heartbreaking that you see it this way. As a gay man who watched this episode with my partner of 6 years we were both sobbing messes when that line dropped and the emotional musk in the air still hasn't fully cleared. Maybe you haven't been in love yet, maybe you might be naive or still a child I don't know.\\n\\nYou know nothing about me, my life, or my relationships. But since I think Frank’s behavior and the way he went about his decision was kinda toxic I must either have never been in love, be naive, or be a child? What the actual fuck?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"A few years after a nasty divorce, I decided it was time for a change of pace. I moved to a different town that was farther away from my ex wife and closer to my daughter who already had a proper job, climbing the ranks at a company with a good paycheck and a loving partner. And I tried my very hardest to fit into this neighborhood. Not only did I host a little neighborhood get together shortly after moving in to meet the neighbors and offer some drinks and some barbecue, but I also took on a job that didn't have as many hours. The rest of my free time I tried spending around the neighbors and make some good friends\\n\\nIt wasn't so bad since I was pretty good looking. I stood at 6'2 with big arms and a large chest, somewhat hairy and had just a bit of a beer belly, just enough to go further forward than my chest. But with the body hair I looked quite fit. I had dark, messy hair, brown eyes, a chiseled jawline and a scruffy beard, going for an odd, but good look. And just for the sake of looks I always wore half tight shorts or pants, just enough to have a visible bulge of my veiny, girthy eight inch shaft and my big, heavy balls\\n\\nAnd I did plenty of favors for the neighbors. Helped fix some sinks, helped someone change the floorboards due to rot and mold. And a good couple of times I went topless to help clean some pools here and there. I quickly got close to many neighbors and people really took a liking to me. And while this would have been viewed as just being nice or generous in my old neighborhood, some people around here were beginning to take a more naughty liking to me. Wanting me topless and hard working in a different scenario\\n\\nAnd it was a large neighborhood with a large variation in both genders and situations. But I wanted to be as friendly as I could with as many neighbors as I could\\n\\n* Anal play\\n* Gape\\n* Rough sex\\n* Showed sex(any water + sex)\\n* Outdoors sex\\n* Risky play\\n* Groping\\n* Spanking\\n* Hair pulling\\n* Slapping\\n* Name calling\\n* Impregnation \\n* Cum play\\n* Excessive cum\\n* Body writing\\n* Photo/video taking and sharing(not irl)\\n* Sex toys\\n* Passionate sex\\n* Drunk sex\\n* Oral\\n* All jobs\\n* Outercourse\\n* Facefucking\\n* Rimjobs\\n* Full Nelson \\n* Mating press\\n* Femdom\\n* Self facials\\n* Facials\\n* Creampies\\n* Casual sex\\n* Crossdressing femboys\\n* Hooking\\n* Skirts\\n* Panties\\n* Thigh highs\\n* Naked apron\\n* Swimsuits\\n* Dresses\\n* Tattoos\\n* Piercings\\n* Body worship\\n* Sweat\\n* Musk\\n* Condom play\\n* Cervix penetration\\n* Squirt\\n* Size difference\\n* Lactation\\n* Clothed sex\\n* Smoking in general\\n* Milfs\\n* Cheating\\n* Cuckold\\n\\nSo, to break it down. Just a Dilf kind of guy who moves into a neighborhood and tries to get along with everyone. But it ends up being naughtier than expected, and he gets roped into doing sexual favors for people rather than friendly favors. This could be a milf who wants some dicking after a long time of being lonely. A younger lady who wants to make her cheating boyfriend jealous by cheating with someone. Or perhaps a young lad interested in exploring some things with a guy\\n\\nHope to hear from you~ the names Alex!\",\n",

Even the wealth of the richest people in the world pales in comparison to the revenue of the richest companies in the world.  \\n\\nAmazon's 2022 revenue was north of half a trillion USD.  Meanwhile they paid a pittance in taxes in most of the counties where they operate thanks to loopholes and beneficial tax structures and the shell game of multinationalism.  And paid their workers so low that they needed benefits, letting tax payers further subsidise their profits.\\n\\nI don't know where the notion came from to talk solely about the net worth of these company's primary stakeholders (values which include the actual value of the companies in question, not some vault full of cash) when the bigger issue by far is how all these corporations making staggering amounts of money (and often record profits) are allowed to get away with paying so little tax and paying so little to their masses of workers.  I can't figure out if it's some kind of conspiracy to try to distract people from how much the governments are to blame for letting companies do this, and how much is just a manifestation of the fact that people are much more bitter that super-rich individuals exist than they are about the fact that companies and governments are screwing them.\",\n",

My fingers merging together into large, clumsy hooves as I find myself pulled down on all fours by my shifting body mass.

Maybe fat people should try it. \\n\\nYou want me to hate you for being fat because it will square with your views on the world. I don't hate you. I don't think you're ugly. I don't even give a shit what you look like at all. How shallow for you to keep banging on about an aspect I never once mentioned. It really shows your mind's focus, not mine. I think you've been served poorly by a world that hates you and I think you would prefer to lay down than fight back. So yeah, I guess that is weakness, but you said it. Not me. \\n\\nIf you won't fight your actual oppression, who else will. You're not oppressed because some people think you're ugly and chairs are small. You're oppressed because no one cares if you live or die as long as you don't fuck up Elon Musk's billionaire space escape plan.\",\n",

Plus it makes for a good first impression. \\n\\n*I felt your bare foot paw press hard against my face, it felt warm but soft on my cheek as my eyes averted up to you. Your smug grin told me all I needed know about your thought process; you finally felt like you had a chance of winning our game of ultimate surrender, or sex fighting as it's known casually. Us both being naked, our sweaty bodies glistening in the fleurescent lights of the arena with our cocks fully erect and begging for sweet release, the only place I wanted to do that was in your holes and on your feet. Meanwhile, you'd get the runner up prize of cumming on the floor like a loser. But first, I had to figure out how to get out of your grasp, turns out you do know a thing or two about how to fight.*\\n\\nHi there! I'm looking for a furry twink, twunk or femboy to rp a sex fighting/ultimate surrender scenario with me. Ultimate surrender is the official porn name for it, but it basically involves nude or semi-nude fighting for domination, with the winner getting to fuck the loser. Since you're a bottom, it'd be expected that you'd lose in the end for obvious reasons but I'm hoping you'll definitely put up a fight as well since that's way hotter lol. \\n\\nEven though it sounds like a pretty simple prompt, there can a decent amount of background to it; a judo class, a porn studio, a wrestling ring etc. There can also be certain roles we have in the rp as well; rival students, pornstars, one of my favourites would be you rping as my slutty judo instructor/fuck buddy.\\n\\nKinks wise, my only real limits are scat, pedo stuff, watersports, rape, vore, gore, daddy kink, straight acting and overly submissive/timid characters.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIn terms of kinks, my major ones include the following: I have a major foot fetish (your feet), rough sex, twinks, twunks, femboys, small dom/big sub, feminisation (you), musk, power bottoms, dirty talk, flirting, teasing, lots of cum, kissing, nudism, clothing, anal play, oil play, flexibility/contortionism. Just to say, my foot fetish is my biggest kink so if that's an issue for you then we won't be very compatible, sorry to disappoint if that's the case. I also have a kink list that shows all of my other ones so if you'd like me to send that on then I'm very happy to!\\n\\nWhat's your favourite colour?\\n\\nSomething I should mention is that this rp is quite detailed and requires an experienced partner who's willing to put in the same amount of effort that I will. That only seems fair if it's an equal partnership, which includes:\\r  \\n\\r  \\n• Being able write around a paragraph or more per reply, although I'll understand if certain responses don't warrant that amount of length.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n• Being creative and fun, which makes sense since you're meant to be a sex demon, that requires being fairly personable and creative which I'm hoping you'll be lol.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n• Being literate, so good grammar and spelling is a must. Being fluent in English is also a must because it tends to affect grammar and sentence structure obviously.\\n\\nHope you're interested! If so then there's a few different ways to contact me:\\n\\n* WarrenXoXo1\\n* WarrenXoXo on Telegram\\n* WarrenXoXo#2139 on Discord\\n\\nThanks!

       "  'body': 'Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday said demand has surged following the price reductions, which executives said were aimed at making Teslas more affordable and qualifying some models for a federal electric-vehicle tax credit.  \\n\\nThe operator of one Tesla-focused YouTube channel organized a petition asking that customers who purchased cars before the lower prices took effect get free or discounted software downloads. It has received more than 6,000 signatures. \\n\\nTesla didn’t respond to requests for comment about the customer reaction to the cuts. \\n\\nTesla in mid-January slashed prices nearly 20% on some vehicles, an unusually steep markdown that comes as rivals raise sticker prices on their own EVs.  \\n\\nSuch a groundswell of customer angst about a price cut is uncommon in the auto industry, where car companies frequently discount models to stimulate sales—albeit in a more selective way. Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at research firm J.D. Power, said he has never seen an auto maker make such an immediate, deep cut across multiple models.\\n\\n“Price really matters,” Mr. Musk said during the company’s earnings call Wednesday. “There’s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car but can’t afford it.” Mr. Musk said the company nudged up the price of a Model Y by about $500 because of strong demand following the mid-January price cut.\\n\\nVikas Khanna, a 48-year-old healthcare executive, paid around $65,000, excluding sales tax, in late December for a Model Y SUV, which included a $7,500 discount offered by Tesla at the time. The price cut would have saved him about $5,000, taking into account fees and upgrades, according to a review of his purchase order.\\n\\n“It just reminded me and solidified why Tesla, as an organization, is one that I can no longer trust,” said Mr. Khanna, who had bought two Teslas over the years before his recent purchase. \\n\\nMr. Khanna said he understands that companies have the leeway to adjust pricing, but he sees a distinction between fluctuations on a car price and other goods, such as mobile phones.\\n\\n“You don’t take out a loan for an iPhone,” he said. \\n\\nThe backlash is the latest hurdle for Mr. Musk and Tesla, which have also faced questions from investors and Wall Street analysts about the underlying demand for the company’s vehicles, and whether the CEO’s Twitter takeover has been a distraction. Tesla’s stock price fell 65% last year, but the stock has rebounded about 44% this month as investors focused on Mr. Musk’s bullish forecast for demand and vehicle output, analysts said. \\n\\nFollowing a price cut in China this month, some Tesla owners said on Chinese social media that they felt betrayed. Around 100 Tesla car owners gathered at a showroom in Changsha, a city in central China, a day after the EV maker announced price cuts, according to a video posted by state media. They showed up with a collective letter requesting compensation such as free charging or loyalty points. \\n\\nTesla’s price cuts come as many U.S. competitors are introducing new EVs, and the reductions undercut some rivals’ models and could potentially pressure other car makers’ profit margins, analysts said.\\n\\nTesla, which sells directly to customers, has more flexibility to adjust pricing relative to legacy auto makers that sell through dealerships. Adjusting the manufacturer’s suggested retail price overnight would be costly and cumbersome for traditional car makers, Mr. Jominy said. \\n\\nInstead, car companies typically set pricing for a specific model year, and adjust by offering discounts, cash-back offers or other incentives on a month-to-month basis.\\n\\nA decline in Tesla resale values also has rankled some owners. Through the first 17 days of January, the list price of model-year 2020 or newer used Teslas was down 25% from the June peak, about double the rate of the industrywide drop, according to data from research site Edmunds.\\n\\nDennis Wang, who runs a YouTube channel for Tesla owners and buyers, started a petition seeking compensation in the form of free services for Tesla owners who purchased their vehicles in 2022. The goal is to return value to Tesla drivers who felt slighted by the cuts, he said.\\n\\n“I think this is a great opportunity for them to, you know, rewrite the sentiment,” said Mr. Wang, who has purchased several Tesla vehicles in the past decade but wouldn’t personally benefit if his petition is successful. \\n\\nKapil Sharma, an industrial consultant who lives outside of Atlanta, asked his Tesla service center about the possibility of a refund after the company slashed prices. He had taken delivery of a new Model Y, his first Tesla, two weeks earlier. \\n\\n“We do not have a return policy and we do not price match or price adjust completed orders,” the company told him in a text message exchange reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nRebecca Elliott and Selina Cheng contributed to this article.',\n",

It would be nice to settle down with a mate, but that's a long shot given it's the internet and not the easiest thing to make work. At the very least it would be nice to have someone to chat with, hangout, and then get dirty when we are in the mood. For partners I generally prefer those with more average or feminine qualities, not into anything super muscled or with wild proportions. My favorite kinks at the moment are breeding, sloppy sex, lots of cum, dirty talking, musk/scent, biting, pet play, aftercare, knotting and marking. My limits are hyper, gore, vore, and scat. So if anything I mentioned catches your eye feel free to message me on telegram with your age, ref, kinks/limits, and anything else you would like to add.\",\n",

A long, swishy tail erupting from the rear of my pants. My neck popping the collar of my shirt as it stretches and thickens with muscle. My nostrils flaring wider and wider as my face pushes out into a lengthy muzzle; ears growing more and more pointed, slowly tugging themselves higher up on my head. My fingers merging together into large, clumsy hooves as I find myself pulled down on all fours by my shifting body mass. My balls swelling larger and heavier between my legs as all traces of humanity leave my shrinking brain, slowly but steadily replaced by animalistic urges. The idea of it all is both frightening and exhilarating.   \\n\\n\\nEspecially if it's an unwilling, humiliating transformation in a public setting. After all, who would want to be forcefully reduced to a dumb farm animal in front of their fellow humans? Looking towards them for help, only to find them staring back with confusion and fear as they keep their distance. With all that said, here's one potential scenario for this concept:  \\n\\n\\n**Bobbing For Apples**  \\n*Everyone knows the apple-bobbing game, whether you've played it yourself or just seen it in a movie. They're most common in the countryside, at festivals, fairs and such. But what if one of the vendors running the game is a dark magic practitioner? What if with each apple successfully pulled out of the water, the player unknowingly loses a bit of their humanity? What will it take for them to realize what's happening - more importantly, will they realize it before their clothes are bursting off of them in the middle of a crowded fair?*  \\n\\n\\nOf course, if you have any ideas of your own I'm all ears! I'm happy to compromise and come up with a  scenario that's perfect for both of us, and would love to hear your own kinks and wishes surrounding this premise.  \\n\\n\\n**Kinks:** feral animal TF, unwilling TF, public settings, humiliation, mental changes, identity death, shredding through clothes, musk, IQ loss, voice loss (+uncontrollable neighing)  \\n\\n\\n**Limits:** underage, death, gore, vore  \\n\\n\\nPlease contact me via DMs only!\",\n",

The problem was that the sensors were very expensive at the time, so you couldn't just put them into cars you sold without adding tens of thousands of dollars on the sales price for something that at the time only provided marginal benefits. \\n\\nBut Elon Musk wanted some futuristic gimmick in order to sell his cars and that ended up being the claim that it was all just a matter of time and some software updates until every Tesla could drive itself. Which everybody in the industry knew was a lie. But in order to sell that lie and provide at least some protection from the inevitable fraud accusations, they couldn't continue focusing on Lidar developement while selling cars without Lidar sensors and claiming software updates were all they needed. So instead they completely focused on camera based self driving tech to at least provide some incremental improvements.\\n\\nNow that people have started to realize that Teslas would never get that Level 3 upgrade, Tesla finally started going back to developing Lidar technology a year or two ago, even though that means they are now way behind everybody else.\",\n",

The robot features a set of desert locust antennae connected to a system that measures signals produced by the antennae when they detect a smell. It can reliably differentiate between eight 'pure' odors.

The feat involved firing powerful laser pulses at thunderclouds for more than six hours. By changing the refractive index of air and ionizing the air molecules around them, the lasers created an easier path for electrical discharge to flow down.

The Guo Wang, or national network, is a network of nearly 13,000 satellites that will provide broadband satellite internet worldwide. Countries that have signed on or are interested in signing on to China's Belt and Road initiative may also be interested in a Chinese-made satellite internet service.

       "  'selftext': 'It was so hard to find a good roommate nowadays, but luckily, it seems like our friendship made us great ones! We both could hang out, have fun, keep the place clean and organized; it was the ideal setup! We did our chores around the place and brought over friends and even romantic partners, but we’d never done anything like that together. You seemed to notice that I was a bit more feminine than some guys, but honestly for a good roommate, that didn’t matter!\\n\\nUntil the one day where you catch me wearing panties that a visitor had left behind. Maybe they were a friends of ours, a relative, an ex, a current gf, etc! But as I stood in my room, sighing happily and taking pictures of my cute butt and little bulge in the panties, you realized your roommate was a femboy. It made so much more sense now! No wonder I had always seemed to get nervous when you came in my room, hoping you wouldn’t realize my secret. But now you knew, so what would you do with a femboy roommate?\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSo that’s my prompt, a bit basic but wanted to leave it open to lots of personalization and discussion! Of course this RP would involve heavy themes of feminization, femboy/sissy, clothing, and control/ownership even!Would love to hear about your character, your kinks/limits, and more details so we can really get detailed and have an engaging RP! I typically write anywhere from 1-3 paragraphs, though can definitely do more if you’re wanting to put the effort in too! All partners welcome of course: female, male, trans, non-binary, etc! If you’re human and interested by this at all, message me! \\n\\nKinks: Kinks: feminization, incest, sissy, pet names/nicknames, femdom, submission, panties/lingerie, outfits/costumes, group play, cuck, controlled/owned, cum, teasing, dirty talk, DDLG/MDLG, light humiliation/blackmail, bulging/outlines, trans/trap, daddy/mommy, giving/receiving, sleep play, etc!\\n\\nLimits: rape, gore, bathroom activities, extreme pain or violence, drug abuse, scent/musk/sweat play, gross stuff.\\n\\nI hope to hear from my roommate soon! Chat or DMs works for me!',\n",

Musk talked about the idea of the Model 3 in like 2008 or so but never gave a release date. Concept cars happen all the time. He did state a firm release date for the Model 3 in 2016 and it came out soon after in 2017 like he said.\\n\\nThe Cybertruck was supposed to come out in 2019. It's 2023 now and a 2nd prototype was shown that's different than the original which makes it seem like they don't have an actual Cybertruck even remotely close to mass production since they're still changing the prototype and 3-4 years behind when the original was supposed to be launched.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\n*Alric\\'s General Store* ~~Once an alchemist\\'s workshop.~~\\n\\n\\n*From the outside, it looks well maintained, pleasant, and snug. Bricks and thick, hard wooden logs make up most of the building\\'s outer structure. It\\'s difficult to see through the curtained windows, but the clinking of glasses and boiling of water from within can be heard outside. If not seen for a trail of white and cyan blue smoke coming from a few of the pipes and the chimney of the house. With a sign hanging just above the entrance, made from finest birch wood, serving as a point of reference or destination depending on the person. Offering a variety of goods despite its recent and rather sudden change. Just below the name, it was all there, written and drawn on the sign:*\\n\\n*Potions, ointments, salves...*\\n\\nAs easy as it is to visit the market and spend a fortune on rare ingredients and top-quality glass. It is never certain if one of those **slackers** calling themselves adventurers would bother to even come over and spend their silver or their gold that they \"earned rightfully\" through a trip to some abandoned dungeons or ruins that were more than likely a resting place of someone\\'s ancestors or aristocratic family.\\n\\n*But there were necromancers inside raising the dead! We had to intervene!*\\n\\n**BUT DID YOU HAVE TO STEAL EVERYTHING THAT APPEARED VALUABLE!?**\\n\\n*Ekhem.*\\n\\nGot a little personal there, but where was I? Ah yes. The struggles of an Alchemist.\\n\\nOr rather, owner of a general store that specializes in alchemy.\\n\\nSee. Despite the talent, personal requests when it comes to brewing specific tinctures and specialized medicine, taxes in [Montera](https://i.imgur.com/UMRj22x.png) are no joke. It is a land of opportunity but only if you have the coin.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I had to adapt a little. Redesinging and repurposing one of my older workshops into the [forge](https://i.imgur.com/nFmO07U.jpg) was difficult, not to mention the heart attack when the dwarf told me the original cost of my request. Needless to say, I was grateful Odrun was a dwarf kind enough to have a sick son I managed to help out with a potion I brewed for him. May Shalya bless his soul and keep him safe from another Crimson Rot infection. Nasty thing.\\n\\nWe settled on a larger workplace, both for my assistant and myself. Sacrificing two of my magazines to fit in the forge and my own laboratory. One which she would visit quite often just so we can stock up on supplies.\\n\\nYes, the idea with the General store relies heavily on her arrival. I\\'m quite aware of how specific I was in the requests but it simply won\\'t work even if I were to have a true genius that had even more experience in knowledge in regards to the sacred arts of my work.\\n\\nNo, I needed the strong folk of the mountains, loud, strong but also honorable neighbors to the Dwarves and Orcs. Hardy folk are as famous for their horns during a charge and for the amount of milk their women can produce. None other but minotaurs, holstaurs, cow-people, and bull-people if you will.\\n\\nDevoted worshipers of Shalya, goddess of life and fertility. *Which fits quite nicely with the jokes you can hear at the tavern about them.*\\n\\nYes, that\\'s where my plan is going. To ensure that alongside the potions, herbs, and general supplies. I could expand on the range of goods I have to offer. With my assistant handling the forge and any requests and also resupplying me with **dairy products**.\\n\\nIt\\'s a dangerous game, especially with the fact I haven\\'t stated that in the contract for the job. Nor did I tell that specific detail to anyone in the guild, but it\\'s the milk, and perhaps another fluid that I seek from the hardy Holstaur women.\\n\\nIt is said to have properties that would enhance my potions. It\\'s something I wish to see for myself. That\\'s why I\\'m hoping to see some hardy adult, or better yet, a mature holstaur woman that has seen her fair share of things. Ready to settle down with a forge as her main workplace, and my lab as a place of relief for her.\\n\\nCourse saying that upfront won\\'t get me anywhere...But that\\'s why I know how to make aphrodisiac and a few other things to make sure her body is willing to cooperate and produce the said milk...No?\\n\\nI\\'m certain the creators look down at me right now. No matter what pantheon or aspect. **BUT IT\\'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES IN THIS BLOODY CITY!**\\n\\n*Now did I check on the Alembic? What\\'s that hissing soun-*\\n\\n***\\n\\nYou\\'ve read all of it? Are you actually interested in this idea?\\n\\nYay.\\n\\nI mean, it would be amazing if you were. The role is painfully specific but if you don\\'t mind playing some MILF or at least some top-heavy gal...Well, all I can say is that I\\'m as always aiming for mix of story and smut...So while it\\'s gonna be lewd I do imagine other activities to write about and describe. And on that note, long messages. Multi-paragraphs. If you\\'re interested hit me up. If you doubt my writing due to the rambly nature of this post then check out the other prompts!\\n\\nFeel free to tell me if you\\'d like to also change something! I\\'m not against mixing things up! Or even the idea of how he acquires her. Etc.\\n\\nThough if it\\'s up to me. Some wholesome and lewd combo would fit best. With moments where the theme changes to something more serious/realistic, dealing with taxes, plague, some disease, nothing that ends with death or misery, at least not for our characters. \\n\\n&gt; Kinks: Amazonian women, either them being dominated or them dominating their partner; breeding; anal, and feet, face sitting, switch relationships, romance, cuddling, playful wrestling, sweat, pubic hair (armpit/crotch), monstrous characters, musk, giantess, frotting, facesitting, grinding, hotdogging, addictive cum (not hypnotizing kind, just more of a satisfying type usually just for futa characters.) , foreskin play, small dom big sub/big dom small sub, futanari, MILF\\'s, very curvy/well-endowed characters, mommy/big sis personality, chubby but strong/big women/futas, fat cocks, big testicles, huge breasts, thick thighs, dark skinned/tanned characters, Foodplay (Kinda related to chubby characters and more extreme fetishes) -&gt; (More extreme kinks from vore and toilet play are fine too but have to be discussed, and also aren\\'t a must/needed to those against them. I\\'m into some of them and I\\'m indifferent to others.)\\n\\n&gt; Not really kinks but writing preferences: Third person, multi-paragraph responses from both sides. (4-6 paragraphs minimum or more.), mutual worldbuilding.\\n\\n&gt; Limits: Abuse, Underage, Cheating, Cuckold, ntr.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that\\'s for us to discuss. So thanks for reading and hope you have a great day!\\n\\n**EDIT: I would be interested in changing the idea slightly perhaps have him as a traveling alchemist, with your character as his bodyguard, that provide the \"Special ingredient\" to his potions. I guess I\\'m just looking for a bit more exploration story&amp;smut this time. So either this variation of the idea, or other prompts (Especially the Kitsune/Oni guardian spirits, or a Giantess Royal Sentinel) are open!**',\n",

She\\'d been traveling through a dry scrubland for a few days now, but that didn\\'t mean the heat was any less miserable.

Her tattered clothes, mud-stained boots and old spear didn\\'t made things much better but at least she wasn\\'t alone. Joining her in the shade was her traveling companion and best friend. A grey donkey she\\'d affectionally named Trotter. They\\'d been together for as long as she could remember, traveling the roads selling the odd trinkets Hannah would make along the way, using it to buy whatever supplies they couldn\\'t get from living off the land.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n\"So, going off of that weird hermit with the rabbit socks said the next village is only half a day down the road. Think we\\'ll run into anything along the way?\" She asked, reaching over to gently pet her donkey on his nose. Instead of adding anything meaningful to the conversation Trotter just did what he always did, nuzzling into her hand and licked her fingers with that large, rough wet tongue of his. It sent a shiver down her spine and got a giggle from the redhead as she pulled her hand away and playfully pushed his head away. \"Gross!

She uses her perfume on Jesus instead of donating it to the poor, when the disciples bring this up Jesus  explains that this is a selfless act and that she should be praised rather than chastised. It has nothing to do with our obligation to other people poverty.  here's the original\\n\\n \\n\\nAware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo his point. Yes poverty will always be a thing, however that doesn't mean we cant work to raise the standard of living for the poor. For example When even the poorest US citizen quality of life today far exceeds that of people 1,000 years ago but that doesn't mean we can't do better.  If we work at it, who know in another 1000 years the poorest people in the world might live better that Elon Musk does now.\",\n",

So Amy is a very curious and easily excited girl, the saying of \"curiosity killed the cat\" could have been renamed \"curiosity killed Amy\" from how little care she has for her own security when she finds something intriguing. She cares deeply for her loved ones like it is usual for a mouse. She may be small but she\\'s ready to bite to defend herself from any meanie trying to bully her or her friends! At that no matter the size of the bully. She\\'s secretly a very submissive and kinky girl. She\\'s also a total tongue slut...it\\'s actually her main kink...being licked makes her go all subby! Same for being belched on! Or farted on!\\n\\nAs for who you are? You\\'re welcome to make all that yourself…either way…I don\\'t mind if we discuss it together! In a dom I\\'m mostly looking for someone confident, warm, rough and primal when needed and teasing and loving when needed…I want you to melt my brain…to be completely made an addict to you. I wanna be yours entirely! I hope to see you on telegram soon enough!~\\n\\nTelegram:\\n@AmyTastyTiny',\n",

But, for you soon to be dicked down posers, I will elaborate. Wannabe dommes are those of you who have been railing girls, futas, femboys and everything else with reckless abandon. Those of you who have slapped down your meaty cock in the face of your partners and been lovingly sucked off before moulding their insides to your rod. Those of you who have been teaching others the joys of being on their knees.\\n\\n  \\nThis all sounds like a normal, and pretty great domme, right? Well, you’re all wannabes because you haven’t met me! Sorry, but you’ll find you’re outmatched everywhere. Got a nice cock? You’ll find yourself outgunned down there, helpless to compete against the fat, veiny, musky monster between my legs. Tucking isn’t an option, so I let it roam free most days, poking out from under my skirt. Oh but there’s an equally massive set of bloated nuts to go with it. I swear I can hear them churning up some pudding thick seed when it’s quiet. They’ll look lovely on your face. Or in your mouth.\\n\\n  \\nLet’s go from between my legs to behind me now. This ass is immaculate. I’ve got more than enough cake to smother you while you eat my ass; if you’re so lucky as to be allowed that honour. When some of you inevitably try to compare yourselves to me, I’ll give you a round of applause using my ass.\\n\\nSome of you poser she-studs probably think you have me beat in the chest considering I don’t have tits. However, if you’re thinking like that, you’re even more pathetic than I could have thought. Your racks are good for a few things. Getting squeezed, sucked on, and jerking my superior femboy cock with.\\n\\n  \\nDo you get the picture yet? You wannabe bulls are just inferior in pretty much every way. Hell, most of you will drop to your knees after just one whiff of my mind-melting musk. But knowing how thick-skulled you wannabe’s can be, I’m sure there are some of you who think you have a chance at topping me. For those of you who are too confident, hit me with your best shot. Let’s see how long you last before your asshole is permanently two inches across :3\\n\\n  \\nNow for this, I don’t have a particular plot in mind so please feel free to bring your own. I am liking the idea of some kind of gameshow or convention setting if you wanna use that as a starter.\\n\\nNow a few things before you message-Firstly, write enough and to a decent standard in your opening message! This is your chance to show me why I should RP with you, put some effort in! Now I don’t mean I want you to write a wall of text of Shakespearian-level writing, but if you send two lines, one of which is a kink list, I won’t be impressed. I want to see what you can do! Dazzle me! Make me drool!\\n\\nSecondly, please include your kinks, limits and a reference image. The sooner we know what is and isn’t on the table, the better! Plus, a ref gives me a great idea of what you are into and helps speed things up.\\n\\n  \\nNow thirdly, if you don’t get a response, it might be because I’m just slow at replying or just have had things take over irl on my end. That being said I will make an effort to be prompt with my replies. If you are unfortunate to not get a response after messaging me, please feel free to respond to any posts I make in the future!\\n\\n  \\nNow onto kinks! I’m into a ton so I’ll list most of my favourites here, but if it’s not within the limits feel free to ask!  \\nBig cocks, sweat, drool, anal, painal, spanking, body writing, humiliation, degradation, bullying, bimbos/bimbofication, dominance loss, fat fucking nuts, worship, mind melting musk, rimming, everything cum, facials, creampies, thick cum, cum vomit, outfit control, lipstick, fisting. Limits are underage, sexual violence, and scat.\\n\\n  \\nOh, last thing. PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME A CHAT.',\n",

I love the use of sex toys as well!\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOther kinks that I'm open to are impact play, CBT, exhibitionism, breathplay, watersports, feet, size difference(big sub/small dom), dub-con, orientation play(straight turned gay), incest(father x son, uncle x nephew), drugging(aphrodisiacs mostly). If you have any other kinks that you'd like to try out, feel free to ask! I'm very open-minded c;\\r  \\n\\r  \\nNow off to my limits. Penetrative sex is a soft limit! I don't do breeding, impregnation, vanilla, gore, snuff, scat, diapers, extremely unrealistic bodies, underage, and weapon play.

However, if a CEO makes 11 million per, year they are taxed at over 50% federal+state, which is an insane amount. To get more than half of your income taken away because the government is an inefficient mess is ridiculous . The average tax rate for all of the US in 2020 was 13.63%. The average tax rate for the top 1% was 25.99%. The tax bracket system as a whole is built to be inequal. Also, Elon Musk just paid the largest tax bill in history. And between state and federal tax was taxed nearly 60%. Because he was compensated with shares as income, they counted as income tax rather than long term capital gains. So if a CEO takes a salary it or gets shares as compensation, it still gets taxed at that insane rate.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Maybe I\\'m being too quick to assume malice here, but I do think the headline is ambiguous. Certainly, if you *already know* it\\'s referring to Chad Loder\\'s suspension, you\\'re not going to misread it, but if you haven\\'t been closely following social media news, I think you could very easily take the headline to mean \"there\\'s a general freeze on left-wing accounts at Twitter\". Certainly I did, until I read the article to find out more.\\n\\nThis might be just an accidental consequence of Headline English - the way newspaper headlines contract sentences to the point where they don\\'t obey typical grammar rules any more, in order to save space and (on physical newspapers) let them use a larger and more eye-catching font. This includes often skipping plurals entirely. \"Musk ordered leftwing account freeze\" isn\\'t proper grammar; it should be \"Musk ordered engineers to freeze a left-wing account\", but that\\'s much longer. Or, to keep it short, \"Musk ordered freeze of leftwing account\", which actually is unambiguously singular, but has one extra word.\\n\\n\"Musk ordered leftwing account freeze\" sounds like there\\'s a Twitter policy called a \"leftwing account freeze\", which was ordered into being by Musk. If you hear that Twitter has something called a \"leftwing account freeze\", I think it\\'s natural to assume it applies to more than one account. Like, if it was \"Musk ordered lewd photo ban\", you\\'d assume it applied to more than just one photo, right?\\n\\nLet\\'s imagine - humour me - that Musk actually *had* ordered a freeze of multiple accounts. How would the headline differ? Would it have to say \"Leaked Twitter Message Suggests Musk Ordered Leftwing Accounts Freeze\"? I mean... maybe it would, but to me the use of \"Accounts\" there sounds like it refers to *financial* accounts. I think it\\'d be the exact same headline in that scenario, because, again, headline english is weird and often skips plurals entirely.\\n\\nPersonally I\\'d have phrased this as \"Leaked Twitter Message Suggests Musk Ordered Loder\\'s Ban\", because then it\\'s unambiguous that it\\'s just one account. But ultimately, it\\'s not worth getting super frustrated about. News sites have brief, eye-catching, alarmist headlines all the time and have done almost since the invention of the newspaper; they were clickbait before clicking was a thing.\\n\\nI\\'ve already spent far too much time fussing over this.

       "  'selftext': \"Hi all! I’ve been on a Poesie kick lately, so I thought I’d share my thoughts. \\n\\nLikes: vanilla, tea, peach, lavender, some patchouli, resins, amber, pepper, most musks, basil, rosemary, woodsmoke.  \\n\\nDislikes: cherry, headshop incense, almond, most berry notes, heavy white florals, super sweet gourmands\\n\\n* **Villa Diodati** *(Pungent wild rosemary and fresh balsam pine, crystal clear lakewater, dry, dark vanilla)* - I’ve been on the hunt for a good rosemary scent for a while, and this one, unfortunately, doesn’t fit the bill. It’s not a bad scent at all; it’s very clean and fresh, with herbaceous rosemary and pine. It gives me “Jason Voorhees after he gets a Queer Eye-style makeover” or “your local Kelpie” vibes. For me, this is primarily a water and pine scent, which is not what I wanted. Still, I can see why this is popular. 3/5\\n\\n* **Tea-Stained Lace** *(Rich pipe tobacco, black tea leaves, vanille, antique lace.) - I’m normally iffy on tobacco notes, but this one scent got good reviews, and I can see why. It’s rich, resinous, sweet, and smoky, but it doesn’t smell like cigarettes. It’s an almost chewy scent. Strong dark academia energy. I can imagine this scent on a hot Victorian gentleman who has requested that you meet him for tea unchaperoned.  My only qualm is that it is a heavy scent, so it’s really only suitable for colder weather. 4.5/5\\n\\n* **Athena** *(Sun-baked Mediterranean herbs and earth, a rich and resinous vanilla spiked with a complex blend of incense and spice, exquisite grey musk)* - Continuing my quest for my perfect rosemary scent with Athena. The rosemary is very prominent in this one, and I can smell this really interesting, almost clay-like note. The “sun-baked” description is very true-to-life here.There’s also a sweet undertone, but its not gourmand at all. If the namesake goddess smelled like this, I’d be like “yeah, that tracks.” However, I feel like this gets sharp and medicinal on me after a while. So my rosemary hunt continues! 3.5/5\\n\\n* **Madar** *(Creamy Basmati rice pudding flavored with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, dried rose petals, sugared pistachios)* - I know Madar is a Poesie fan favorite, and I totally understand why. This is lovely. It’s a sweet gourmand, but not overly sugary, and I love the rice note combined with the spices. It’s cozy and warm. The only problem is that this is so, so faint on me, and I don’t know why. I’d get a FS for sure if it was stronger. 4/5\\n\\n* **Library Ghost** *(Studious marshmallows surrounded by books, ink, and polished wood)* - If you are like me and you enjoy the dark academia aesthetic, you will love this. It’s got the distinct smell of old books and ink and an old library, but the marshmallows add a lovely sweetness without making this a foodie fragrance. It’s a perfect balance of notes and I absolutely love this. 5/5\\n\\n* **Scholomance** *(Ancient castle walls under a forest floor, dragon’s blood incense, a wicked blend of green herbs and rich spices)* - Look, I’ll be honest: I don’t love atmospherics. I appreciate the artistry in creating them, but I don’t like wearing them. This scent smells like it jumped straight out of Castlevania; it’s a dark creepy forest with the spires of an old stone castle in the distance. There's quite a bit of spice in there too. This is just not my thing, but if you like spooky atmospherics, you may like it. 2/5\\n\\n* **Green Girl** *(Pistachio, wildflower honey, oatmilk matcha latte, heliotrope blossoms, marshmallow musk)*  - I picked this one to try because the notes really intrigued me; it’s a fairly unusual combination, plus I love anything matcha. On me, this one is a morpher. It starts out smelling like a super sweet matcha oatmilk latte, as per the description. But then the heliotrope and honey come in and cut the sweetness; I also get something salty, which I think is the pistachios. This is a strong fragrance with lots of throw. Overall, it’s very unique and kind of weird. I honestly don’t know what to make of it? I think I don’t like it though?? I’m going to test it again and see if my opinion changes. ???/5\\n\\n* **Cozy** *(Spicy cardamom and rich vanilla) - Sometimes simplicity is what you want. This smells exactly like what it is: it’s a rich, but not foodie vanilla with spicy, delicious cardamom. It’s not gourmand at all; rather, its a very warm and comforting scent, like being wrapped in a cashmere blanket. It’s a low throw skin scent, but that really works with the scent profile. Definitely a must if you like cardamom and/or vanilla. 4.5/5\\n\\n* **Children of the Night** *(Inky black tea, vanilla lace, distant bonfire smoke, ivy climbing up an ancient stone wall, and a soft bite of pepper)* - Okay, I have to admit that I am extremely biased about this one because: I’m the one who came up with it. I’m incredibly honored to have had my scent idea picked for the Dracula collection contest. My idea behind this scent was vampires in a more romantic, byronic hero context, which is something we start to see following the macabre sophistication of the Count in Dracula. I wanted a scent that was both dark and elegant that evoked the Victorian setting of the novel and to me, this is perfect. It’s got Poesie’s amazing black tea note with a hint of smoke, cut by a non-gourmand vanilla and this undercurrent of something cold and green from the stone and ivy. It’s a perfect mix of sweet and wearable atmospheric. It’s very much what I imagined when I submitted the scent description and I’m so glad other people can enjoy it as well. 5/5\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed my reviews!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '\\nHello everyone! Today I\\'m trying out a prompt that I know is kinda cliche but has really sounded fun to me lately. I\\'m hoping to play out some kind of porn casting or modeling shoot that ends up going way beyond what was described, and maybe even in a fantasy setting if you like that kind of stuff!\\n\\nI can start off innocent and not knowing much but I\\'ll be turned into a star of an awfully depraved film, or be a bit more aware if you\\'d like.  What I\\'m not a big fan of though is the trope of \"you signed a contract so you have to do this\". To get into a specific, let’s say it’s something where I’ve been trying to make it big as an influencer. So addicted to my Instagram and Tiktok and how much attention I can get with getting likes and guys commenting. And naturally this leads to me noticing how my somewhat riskier content is what gets more and more popular. So I reach out to modeling agencies hoping to get set up with someone who will help take my career to the next level. When I get to the modeling shoot though, (either a farm for a country girl shoot or something like an abandoned warehouse) it’s more of the creepy old men type than hipster industry experts that I thought I’d meet. They manipulate my need for attention, and even do things like convince me to start trying coke since that’s what all models love to do. But that just makes it easier and easier to push me into different content, and before I know it I’m a full blown pornstar! And they won’t forget that i came here with my obsession over my social media…I’d love them to get their hands on my phone and posting some clips from my new videos I’m making for all my friends and family to see!\\n\\nDisclaimer: this is purely fantasy of course, and as always will only chat with other adults and am an adult.\\n\\nDefinitely in a pretty dark mood today so people who are down to get pretty wild with this will definitely be getting top priority. I\\'ve also been loving the idea of the modeling being at a farm lately if that intrigues you! I love the idea that I’m trying to make it as some kind of influencer, tricked into believing this is what it’ll take to make it big. My need for attention starts with things like Instagram likes but you can show me how I can get so much more viewage online if I’m willing to do way more on Instagram. And once I’m really broken we could even have me posting to my Instagram anyway for all my friends and family to see. I love that kind of humiliation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso please don\\'t just jump right in sending me a whole starting scene, I like to discuss how were going to be doing this before we start. \\n\\nMy kinks are: anal/DP, slapping, choking, hair pulling, outfits, face fucking, vomit, drug play, violence and snuff,  musk and filth, watersports, gangbangs, raceplay, beast, plenty more too!\\n\\nNot going to have any limits with this prompt for now',\n",

On Twitter, on the other hand, there is always someone lurking to counter you but this also allows for confrontation, within the limits of what the length of a tweet allows. Regarding privacy, as also stated in the linked article, it can be even worse than Twitter because, after all, apart from a few cases, who the hell knows who really runs an instance and what use they make of it? Last note: ironically, the EFF columnist is blatantly skewed in favor of Mastodon in his endnote but his article reports sharing links to Twitter and Facebook, not to some Mastodon instance. To me, finally, it makes suspicious all this hype in recent months in favor of Twitter pushed even in the mainstream media that began, strange coincidence, when Musk\\'s intention to acquire Twitter began to become clear.

Nothing special, but it does what it needs to. Growing up, I've always been curious about gay stuff, especially oral. I tried it in 2021 and I didn't know how I felt. This time however, I couldn't of dreamed of a better experience.\\n\\nSo the story takes place in August. It was a warmer day and I was driving around. I was bored and kinda horny, so I hopped on Sniffies to see if anyone was out. I saw that one person was at this park. It was a nice park with a hiking trail and some bathrooms. I looked at the guy and thought he was cool. He was a 30 year old, 300lb with a 6in uncut. I shot him a hello message and we talked. He told me he was thinking of heading out since nobody was comin by. He had walked in on two guys goin at it and he finished them off. I asked if he would stay for a few extra minutes and he happily agreed.\\n\\nI show up at the park, park my car, and walk to the bathrooms. He told me to knock on the stall 3 times and he'd let me in. So I knock, he opens the stall, and I'm presented with this beautiful man. I hopped into the stall, he sat down, and I stripped to just my socks. As I approached him, he beckoned me close and he put my hard dick in his mouth. The feeling was legendary! After sometime, he stood up and I got on my knees. His cock was kind of cold, but I liked that. He had a good musk that made the whole experience amazing. His cock slid into my mouth and I began to suck. While I did, I massaged his balls. Eventually, he had me stand up. We jerked each other off a bit and I explored his body. Eventually, he sat back down on the toilet and sucked me again. This time, he made me cum. He gripped my balls and sucked my cock so well. His cum going down my throat was a boost of ecstasy. Then, it was my turn. I got on my knees and did the same thing. He let me know when he was close and I swallowed his load. It wasn't a monster load, but it tasted good. After that, we got dressed, I washed my hands a bit, and we both left.\",\n",

If they did lose, they would not be in a position to loan people money, or the interest rate would be unaffordable.\\n\\nI\\'ve gotten a personal loan from a bank, with no security. Interest rate was considerably higher, but not unreasonable. And when you can present a business plan to the bank, that reduces the risk as well.\\n\\n&gt; Yes, your eliminating investors, and making it so the only way to receive funding is through loans.\\n\\nLoaning is a **form** of investment, just without the nasty long-term ethical consequences.\\n\\n&gt; We are back at square 1, your cutting more than 20 times the available funding from business. You have not even challenged this, just circled back.\\n\\nThis \"20 times the funding\" you keep alluding to is a shell game / bubble.\\n\\nWhen you incorporate a company, and then sell pieces of it, you are selling three things:\\n\\n1. A right to the profits (which would have existed without equity).\\n2. The ability to control the workers at that company.\\n3. The material assets owned by that company.\\n\\nThe proportion of 1 vs. 2 varies wildly; 3 is always relatively quite low. I don\\'t have a problem with selling **time-delimited** forms of (1), but (2) is clearly unacceptable. I have a strong moral and practical objection to being able to sell the rights to *people*.\\n\\nGiven this distinction, funding models that support **limited** versions of (1) and (3) are quite acceptable. If most of that \"20 times the funding\" you keep coming back to is from (2), then tough shit, because selling the ability to control people is not worth any amount of economic growth, since it is tantamount to slavery.\\n\\n&gt; A good economy is one that rewards individuals higher for their greater contribution to society.\\n\\n1. A rarer contribution is not a greater contribution.\\n2. Then by all reasonable metrics, capitalist societies fail, since it gives billions to the Bezos\\'s / Musk\\'s of the world who contribute nothing.\\n\\n&gt; No, because these jobs did not exist last week, and are aiming to replace your business as they do the same thing far more efficiently. Your workers are not going to vote for someone that will replace them. You have the problem of the workers in the candle factory voting against the guy wanting to introduce the light bulb.\\n\\nSo now you\\'re not talking about the executive chef, you\\'re talking about automation. Because the executive chef *is* clearly necessary and workers would not vote against her presence.\\n\\nI\\'m not worried about automation. A company that votes against automation, will be out-competed by another company that embraces it.\\n\\n&gt; Under capitalism the owner would need to drop the cost of product while maintaining higher quality as competition will wipe the floor of him if he makes a profit above industry standard (usually about 4-7%).\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t change the fact that he keeps most of that 4-7% for himself, instead of the workers getting raises / better working conditions. It was clear the numbers were made up. It should also be clear that \"0 to most workers\" is a terrible arrangement.\\n\\n&gt; Under socialism, the restaurant has closed a long time ago, because the workers refuse to vote to get themselves into retrenchment ...\\n\\nThere is no reason to believe this. A common capitalist belief is that workers are morons, who are incapable of seeing the writing on the wall or making investments, and need a business daddy to save them from their own ineptitude.

I'm looking for a furry twink, twunk or femboy to rp a sex fighting/ultimate surrender scenario with me. Ultimate surrender is the official porn name for it, but it basically involves nude or semi-nude fighting for domination, with the winner getting to fuck the loser. Since you're a bottom, it'd be expected that you'd lose in the end for obvious reasons but I'm hoping you'll definitely put up a fight as well since that's way hotter lol. \\n\\nEven though it sounds like a pretty simple prompt, there can a decent amount of background to it; a judo class, a porn studio, a wrestling ring etc. There can also be certain roles we have in the rp as well; rival students, pornstars, one of my favourites would be you rping as my slutty judo instructor/fuck buddy.\\n\\nKinks wise, my only real limits are scat, pedo stuff, watersports, rape, vore, gore, daddy kink, straight acting and overly submissive/timid characters.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIn terms of kinks, my major ones include the following: I have a major foot fetish (your feet), rough sex, twinks, twunks, femboys, small dom/big sub, feminisation (you), musk, power bottoms, dirty talk, flirting, teasing, lots of cum, kissing, nudism, clothing, anal play, oil play, flexibility/contortionism. Just to say, my foot fetish is my biggest kink so if that's an issue for you then we won't be very compatible, sorry to disappoint if that's the case. I also have a kink list that shows all of my other ones so if you'd like me to send that on then I'm very happy to!\\n\\nWhat's your favourite colour?\\n\\nSomething I should mention is that this rp is quite detailed and requires an experienced partner who's willing to put in the same amount of effort that I will. That only seems fair if it's an equal partnership, which includes:\\r  \\n\\r  \\n• Being able write around a paragraph or more per reply, although I'll understand if certain responses don't warrant that amount of length.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n• Being creative and fun, which makes sense since you're meant to be a sex demon, that requires being fairly personable and creative which I'm hoping you'll be lol.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n• Being literate, so good grammar and spelling is a must. Being fluent in English is also a must because it tends to affect grammar and sentence structure obviously.\\n\\nHope you're interested! If so then there's a few different ways to contact me:\\n\\n* WarrenXoXo1\\n* WarrenXoXo on Telegram\\n* WarrenXoXo#2139 on Discord\\n\\nThanks!

       "  'selftext': \"Toyota (NYSE:TM) is not only defending its title as the world's top-selling automaker for a third year in a row, but it is doing so by a wide margin. Including subsidiaries Hino Motors and Daihatsu, group sales reached 10.5M vehicles in 2022, compared to the 8.3M of its second-ranked rival Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY). The news comes after Toyota shocked the industry with its first CEO transition in 14 years that could indicate a stronger focus on next-generation vehicles.\\n\\nBigger picture: Despite production constraints caused by COVID-19 and increased demand for semiconductors, Toyota's total sales were in line with its figure from 2021 versus a 7% annual drop seen at VW. Pressures from poorly stocked dealerships and dwindling savings have been seen across the globe, as well as the U.S., which just marked its worst showing for car sales in over a decade. Financing new vehicles is also growing more expensive than ever, with 15.7% of American car buyers having a record-high monthly payment of more than $1,000.\\n\\nIn 2021, Toyota even surpassed General Motors (NYSE:GM) as the best-selling automaker in the U.S. (see how here), though it doesn't remain its long-term goal as the company sets its sights on the transformation of the auto industry. Toyota has been diversifying its portfolio into a broad range of vehicle classes, including ICE, EV, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cells, a strategy that it has continued to pursue for decades (the first Prius was released in 1997). While Toyota has recently doubled down on its all battery-electric vehicles, SA author Doron Levin says it is not moving fast enough when factoring in its global footprint, though he does like the company's dividend, which is paying a yield of nearly 3%.\\n\\nFully electric or plug-in hybrid? As the BEV or PHEV debate rages on the world stage, many are sizing up how things will play out, especially given governmental intervention (see green energy subsidies and tax breaks) and the starting lines of various automakers. SA contributor Ramy Taraboulsi flags some interesting winners in the race, even if their strategies and business models are flawed. See how he stacks up the visions of Toyota versus Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), as well as their core competencies and financial projections. (365 comments)\\n\\nSurvey Monday\\n\\nThe major U.S. stock averages are pointing to a lower open this morning, kicking off a week packed with macro events and major tech earnings. At the time of writing, Nasdaq 100 (NDX:IND) and S&amp;P 500 futures (SPX) are off 1.4% and 1%, respectively, while contracts linked to the Dow (INDU) are 0.7% lower. The biggest item on the calendar will likely be the FOMC's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and while the Fed looks certain to hike rates by a slower 25 bps pace, what's not so clear is what comes next. Any thoughts?\\n\\n· No more hikes, they're done\\n· One more quarter-point bump\\n· Rates will hit 5% or more\\n\\nTake the survey and see the results here\\n\\nPrices at the pump\\n\\nU.S. gasoline prices have surged 12% over the past month to average $3.51 per gallon, threatening the Fed's inflation fight and potentially extending last year's big rally in refinery equities. Although winter storms in December contributed to tighter supply, January's mild weather may have led to more drivers that are pushing up pump prices. Gasoline exports have also doubled from a year ago as China's reopening means there are more people using fuel, while diesel is rising again toward 2022's highs as Europe bans Russian oil products starting Feb. 5. Valero (VLO) was the first of the major refiners reporting Q4 earnings last week, easily beating Wall Street estimates and wrapping up its best year on record. Seeking Alpha Quant Ratings are also heavily bullish on industry players like PBF Energy (PBF) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC). (42 comments)\\n\\nChina's response to ChatGPT\\n\\nChinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) is reportedly planning to roll out an artificial intelligence chatbot service similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT in March, which would launch as a standalone application and gradually merge with its search engine (will Microsoft do the same?). To note, chatbots in China currently focus on social interaction, though ChatGPT performs better at more professional tasks, such as programming and essay writing. Apart from research in AI, Baidu is developing autonomous driving technology. Last month, the company was also dropped from the Nasdaq 100 amid several changes to the closely watched index.\\n\\nWe want your feedback!

       "  'body': 'I’m not a fan, but Musk is smart about some things. Mainly in looking for places traditional big industries were ignoring. The auto industry decided years ago to intentionally ignore EVs. Musk realized this was a weak point and pushed Tesla in that direction. Space was dominated by ossified aerospace companies that moved too slowly and overcharged, relying on politicians to determine goals and design of rockets to meet political goals. Musk taught himself some basic rocket science and realized that a company could be successful by simply figuring out how to most efficiently put stuff in orbit for the lowest price. He quickly attracted tons of talented scientists and engineers who were tired of working in the old system and just wanted to put stuff in space.  \\nThose successes were real, despite people trying to fit them into a narrative about how Musk is a charlatan. But the important point is that he’s good at a very specific thing, not at all things. His abject failure at Twitter, his callousness at the idea of organized labor, and his embrace of Internet troll culture and anti-science are all evidence of that.',\n",

The company announced early in the year that it had received the necessary approval for the spin-out of Formation Metals. It is now working to fulfill the remaining closing requirements, which include getting the TSX Venture exchange’s final approval of the arrangement.\\n\\n**Company Overview**\\n\\nUsha’s business strategically negotiates and buys precious metals and early-stage battery projects with low start-up costs. The company transforms its properties from an idea, into a highly prospective project with immediate upside potential. The Company performs prudent due diligence under the supervision of its highly experienced and diverse board and technical team.\\n\\nThe company owns three up-and-coming projects: the Lost Basin-gold copper, Jackpot Lake lithium, and Nicobat nickel-copper-cobalt projects. Usha Resources seeks to develop into a best-in-class mining company by responsibly and safely pursuing the essential metals needed for tomorrow’s global economy.\\n\\n**Jackpot Lake Project (Flagship Property)**\\n\\nThe Jackpot Lake Lithium Brine Property comprises 140 mineral claims covering 2,800 acres and is situated in Clark County, 35 kilometres northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada (approximately 11.3 km2). The geologic model is comparable to that of Albemarle’s Silver Peak Nevada Lithium Mine, the only producing lithium mine in North America, which has been in continuous operation since 1966. The project target is a 5 x 2 km anomaly that was found based on the following research, which points to the presence of a highly concentrated brine:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92g77hk1dffa1.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9fa402cb01e249d7b064b03fd99bd24273026faa\\n\\n* The potential for lithium mineral deposits was confirmed by spectrographic and atomic-absorption analyses of 135 stream sediment samples and data from 129 core samples that the USGS collected, with an average lithium value of 175 ppm and a high of 550 ppm. Currently, Albemarle’s project has a middle grade of about 121 ppm.\\n* A closed basin was found by gravitational surveying, essential to ensure that brines stay inside the basin without being diluted by outside water sources.\\n* Gravitational and controlled source audio magnetotellurics/magnetotellurics (CSAMT/MT) surveys used in geophysical modelling have revealed the presence of highly concentrated brines relatively close to the surface.\\n* The Jackpot Lake Project’s CSAMT survey results show a significant, consistent body of very low resistivity throughout the property, primarily above ground. This behaviour is consistent with highly concentrated brine.\\n\\n**U.S. Drastically Increasing Battery Production**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7eiw3d13dffa1.png?width=408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e103ba4d7ae68dfa1069bbe5420300e356b0cd0b\\n\\nSource: [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chinas-dominance-in-battery-manufacturing/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chinas-dominance-in-battery-manufacturing/)\\n\\nWith China currently winning the E.V. race and dominating the Lithium supply chain, drastic measures are being taken in the USA to encourage both loca minings of Lithium and domestic production of Battery Manufacturing.\\xa0\\n\\n**Recent North American Initiatives to combat China’s Increased Dominance**\\n\\n**With both Republican &amp; Democrat lawmakers concerned about China, they’ve signed the most significant E.V. legislation in history designed to outcompete rivals in China &amp; Europe.**\\n\\n*“Since U.S. President Joe Biden signed the bill into law August 16, at least five major EV manufacturers and battery minerals suppliers, including Toyota Motor Corp., L.G. Energy Solution Ltd. and Piedmont Lithium Inc., have announced billions of dollars worth of investments in the domestic production capacity encouraged by the legislation. The bill expands tax credits for E.V.s and includes domestic sourcing requirements to promote the development of a local E.V. supply chain to form the backbone of Biden’s clean energy policy.”*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/voat7r24dffa1.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9ae76f58cefb921f62dfbb5c4944e9cee547dbc5\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60387kd5dffa1.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ed6714d54f0deadc5747b8fa025f944830bd4312\\n\\nAs shown in the above image, since the bill came into effect, billions of dollars in investment have come in from Manufacturers.\\n\\nThe Legislation seeks to move the far-flung battery supply chain into the U.S. and allied nations such as Canada and Australia. The legislation created a tax credit equivalent to 10% of the cost of production for certain critical minerals used to manufacture E.V.s, including aluminum, lithium and graphite.\\n\\nThe bill also contains measures to implement the Defense Production Act, which may boost domestic critical minerals processing. Companies making lithium-ion battery cells for E.V.s will enjoy a tax credit of $35 per kWh for each cell produced, trimming off a significant portion of the cost, and battery makers will get a tax credit of $10 per kWh on battery modules.\\n\\nAll of which are beneficial for Producers.\\n\\n**The Nevada Advantage**\\n\\nUSHA’s Flagship Lithium property is primarily located in Clark County, about 35km NorthEast of Las Vegas, and comprises 140 mineral claims over 2,800 Acres.\\n\\nThe good thing about the project is that the geological setting is very similar to Albemarle’s Silver Peak Nevada Lithium Mine. That mine has been producing lithium and has been continuous since 1966.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9v7util6dffa1.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=150f8a70597337d4e182fce98c3a1276d7919077\\n\\n*Figure 3 – 3D model of Usha’s Jackpot Lake interpreted lithium brine target. The interpreted geophysical target with borehole locations overlain on the local topography produced using Maptek Vulcan. The surrounding formations of the Muddy Mountains are theorized to be the source of lithium in the area. The shell shown in yellow comprises geophysical results indicating resistivities of &lt;5ohm metres.*\\n\\n**USHA’s Current Drill Program**\\n\\nThe company has actively drilled over 2,700 meters over six holes and intends on commending its maiden drill program to establish a 43-101 resource. Suppose the similarities to Albermarle’s deposit prove consistent with the Jackpot Lake property. In that case, we may see sediments from lithium‑rich surrounding source rocks accumulate and fill the deposit leading to a potential concentration of lithium brine due to subsequent evaporation and concentration events.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ois3j0r7dffa1.png?width=252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2347402225c34bbca4c8fd4fa876a9bd16a1e487\\n\\n**Previous Work Done on the Property**\\n\\nThe current drill program was spurred by previous findings, which suggested to management that this must be followed up.\\n\\n*The following historical work has been completed that suggests the presence of a highly concentrated brine with the potential to contain lithium:*\\n\\n* *The USGS collected one hundred twenty-nine core samples with an average lithium value of 175 ppm with a high of 550 ppm and spectrographic and atomic-absorption analyses of 135 stream sediment samples confirming the potential for lithium mineral deposits. The present average grade for Albemarle’s project is approximately 121 ppm.*\\n* *Gravitational surveying, which has identified a closed basin, is critical for ensuring brines remain within the basin without dilution from external water sources.*\\n* *Geophysical modelling based upon gravitational and controlled source audio magnetotellurics/magnetotellurics (CSAMT/MT) surveys have provided evidence of highly concentrated brines relatively near the surface. The CSAMT survey results of the Jackpot Lake Project demonstrate a large body of very low resistivity – consistent with highly concentrated brine behaviour – throughout the property, predominantly above bedrock depths of 625 meters.*\\n\\n*Source: Website*\\n\\n**Lithium Pricing**\\n\\nThe Macro picture for Lithium is pretty wild. Lithium prices gained 442.8% in 2021 and ended 2022 up another 72.5%. Most of this is due to rising demand that isn’t going away anytime soon.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4teotdt8dffa1.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=84011c84560e066d5781651e86ed6c82314eee54\\n\\n“Gigafactories,” –Elon Musk’s once-novel word for his five battery factories worldwide–will soon be regarded as a major part of the critical national infrastructure. There are over 300 battery gigafactories in the global pipeline, ensuring strong demand.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5o4o0hv9dffa1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c0ef31a7316adc4a9ff308a837893217b357c36\\n\\n**SpinOut Catalyst**\\n\\nWhen the market values your company as less than the sum-of-the-parts, management often divests property so that shareholders realize gains. USHA has announced plans to spin-out out their Nicobat property in Northwest Ontario to unlock more excellent value for shareholders.\\n\\n**Nicobat Project Summary**\\n\\nNicobat is a nickel-copper-cobalt project in the Rainy River District in northwest Ontario, Canada. Mine development is ongoing in the area, with excellent access to roads, trains, power, and water. A 1,860-meter, 10-hole drilling program that Crystal Lake Mining completed in 2015 proved the existence of high-grade nickel-copper shoots that are significantly better than those previously noted in the historical drilling program (Drill hole A-04-15 intersected a weighted average of 1.05% nickel and 2.18% copper from the surface to 63.75 meters.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwrn8ltadffa1.png?width=273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f0531d546c8ab7495161f6a402b5b91c1e4283dd\\n\\nOf course, 99.76% of voting shareholders voted in favour of the spin-out. Each USHA shareholder will receive one common share of Formation Metals(the spin-out company) for every 5 USHA shares they hold on the record date.\\n\\nThis could be a catalyst for the USHA share price as you may get some investors buying before the Ex-Dividend date to receive the “free” Formation Metals shares.\\n\\n**Share Structure/Financials**\\n\\nThe company shared its financial statements for September 30, 2022. Usha has a solid balance sheet with $1.6M in cash for no debt. Usha Resources has few expenses as the company spent less than $300k, and the highest costs were for consulting fees. Usha Resources has a beautiful share structure. Indeed only 35.6M shares are issued and outstanding, 2.3M options and 8.5M warrants are available.\\n\\nDespite the TSXV’s valuation decrease, the company’s market cap remained relatively steady, showing strong interest from investors. The stock price is worth $0.28 and witnessed a 52-week range variating from\\xa0 $0.205 to $0.39.\\n\\nComparables to Other Nevada Projects\\n\\n**Bottom Line**\\n\\nUsha Resources\\xa0 (TSXV: USHA, OTC: USHAF, FRA: JO0) is well-funded ($1.6M in cash), has a tight share structure (35.6M shares outstanding), and their crown jewel Jackpot Lake property checks the right boxes in taking advantage of U.S. growing ambitions to outcompete China in the E.V. and lithium space.\\xa0\\n\\nApproving the previously announced proposed spin-out of its wholly owned-subsidiary Formation Metals Inc. Varshney providing a 20% “share dividend” to shareholders at no cost brings excitement to the company. The company is attractive and shows much upside.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I know I would only get a fraction, but that doesn\\'t change the fact I want it. I don\\'t want something for nothing, I wanted something for something, but capitalism has made it impossible for me to get the engaging STEM job I wanted. I\\'d still rather have something for nothing than nothing for nothing.\\n\\nI am well aware that some people squander inheritances. Just because Musk isn\\'t a COMPLETE idiot doesn\\'t entitle him to that level of wealth. I\\'d have that kind of money too if my parents owned an emerald mine, so why should he get it and not me just because my parents don\\'t have an emerald mine? It\\'s not like that mine was the fruit of anything he did. It\\'s bullshit that people get to be rich just because their parents were. Every cent of inheritance should go to the state.\\n\\nMost businesses fail within the first five years, so that doesn\\'t sound like an investment statistically in my favor. I get starting a business if you have a revolutionary idea, but very, very few people have the luck of stumbling upon such an idea. Might as well invest myself in the lottery at that point.\\n\\nHow am I ever going to earn more than minimum wage? There are no useful skills to develop since virtually everything has been outsourced except fry cooks, janitors, and the like. Even STEM, the one set of skills said to still be worth learning, I learned isn\\'t worth learning. I have a side gig where I hunt for antiques to sell on Ebay and that at least provides me a relatively stable existence, but it\\'s not like my life is ever going to change under capitalism.\\n\\nEven if I were rich, what would I do with the money? Live in a mansion when I don\\'t even use all the space in my apartment? Would a Lamborghini take me places my 1998 Toyota can\\'t? Would having a watch that says \"Rolex\" on it allow me to tell the time better than my plastic Walmart watch? To me, establishing socialism and ending climate change and poverty sounds like a much more worthwhile venture. I\\'d rather be an average person under socialism than a rich person under capitalism.',\n",

I come with some ideas I have in mind except this is more about lending a helping hand and helping those in need. Like all of my ideas this one is centered around curvy women or just women with big butts in general.\\n\\n*I don\\'t mind playing as a female but I\\'m a dominant person so regardless I prefer to be a dom whether I\\'m playing as a guy or woman.*\\n\\n*------------------------*\\n\\nBeing charitable and helping the less fortunate is a kind thing to do, give them clothes, food, a shower, a place to sleep, all sorts of things.\\n\\n But of course this is DPP so it\\'s gonna have a kinky twist, offering someone a place to stay to get sex out of them or offering it thinking it\\'s a kind thing to do, maybe the homeless person finds some new wealth and bring their helpful partner up to the top with them later? Here are some options but feel free to send your own suggestions.\\n\\n&gt;Old Men: much older men helping younger women\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Option 1: She got evicted from her apartment due to her previous landlord being greedy, luckily, her father knew someone who was willing to offer a place to stay while she attended college. At first things seemed great, she was shy and innocent but as time went on she slowly started to do small things that caught his attention, leggings, tight dresses, tight jeans, etc. Was she trying to get his attention? Maybe he\\'s seeing things due to the lack of female interactions? Perhaps things will get a little more serious down the line.\\n\\nShe might be a little more straight forward with her advances, he could wake up one morning and find her in her underwear, or better yet, nothing on at all. She could be watching a movie with him and do subtle things with him like if they were cuddling she could push her phat ass against his crotch or if she has her head on his lap she could rub her cheek against the large bulge in his pants. She might give him a morning surprise of licking his cock, jerking him off, or be riding him with her big ass making his cock disappear.\\n\\nWith a young and attractive girl she might have more than one way to show her appreciation of helping her out and giving her a place to stay after her rude landlord threw her out. How much would this old man appreciate the thanks of this young college age woman? Will he be hard to win over or will be so engulfed in lust that he is willing to do anything for the feeling of that sweet relief he hasn\\'t experienced in years?\\n\\nThe idea of having a warm mouth around his cock while her tongue circling his tip or her big phat ass engulfing his cock, the thoughts and possibilities of what can happen will be too good to pass up but can he give in? Her big phat ass roaming around and the only thing that is keeping him from being balls deep inside her is him giving her the green light and fabric of their clothes. It\\'s like she\\'s practically begging for it so why she he hold back anymore? All he has to do is say \"please do it\" and he can finally experience the pleasure he haven\\'t felt in so many years.\\n\\n*------------------------*\\n\\n&gt;Young Women: young women helping older men\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Option 1: It was the winter season near the holidays, she stumbled across this old homeless man and took it upon herself to help this poor old man. She helped him up, invited him to her place, gave him something warm to eat and drink, and some warm clothes to help him survive.\\n\\nOr she could took this opportunity to have fun with him, and in DPP fashion, that\\'s exactly what she did. She found this poor old man shivering in the cold. She ends up finding the old man, cold and looking lifeless, she tries to help the poor man by sitting him up, trying to warm him up as she rubbed his arms, his legs, his cock? Yes she took out his big old cock and started jacking him off saying it\\'s life or death, he was startled but having the hands of a young college woman around his cock sent him into lust overflow and just accepted it. Soon his friends came around couldn\\'t believe what they were watching as this woman was going at it, soon they started saying they were in desperate need so she took it upon herself to gather them all up and take her to her home. She stripped them all down and started stroking all of them, taking turns with each one as she kept telling them to stay with her.\\n\\nAt first they found it insane that this woman was just doing it randomly but how can they complain about this woman with a phat ass wanting to milk them dry?  Going from jacking them off to sucking them off then to them having a full on gangbang with her! Two in her pussy, maybe three depending on how they positioned themself, two being taking turns with her mouth and two at each hand taking turns with her hands. \\n\\nIt\\'s not easy saving the unfortunate from the shivering cold weather but a hero must save lives no matter how tough it might be or how messy it might get. Some good deeds must be done when most don\\'t want to.\\n\\nCome join this woman in a cum filled adventure of helping these old men from suffering in the cold and helping them warm up to a more healthy state and relaxation. Having them feel with tender hands of a caring woman, the warm mouth and caressing tongue, her tight warm pussy that just wants to milk every drop, her big and phat ass that is so tight it could make a man cum in seconds. I\\'m pretty sure these old men would be in heaven with a woman like this, what do you think?\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Option 2: The cab was shaking and rocking, luckily there\\'s no vehicle in sight to interrupt this moment that is going on in the cab of this semi truck. He was a simple truck driver himself that needed a lift after quitting his job and was lucky to find that this other truck driver chose to stop and pick him up but what he didn\\'t plan on was her to be riding him aggressively in the sleeper cab, bouncing her huge ass on his lap as she is milking him dry for every drop he could give her. \\n\\nShe was a simple tomboy trucker, she spent a lot of time on the road alone and craved some sort of attention, someone to satisfy her lust, but then she found him. He was just an ordinary older who was willing to do anything to get further down the road and that\\'s exactly how he advertised it to her. She was willing to take him wherever he needed to go exchange of something and that\\'s how it started. First him pleasuring her orally, then using his hands, and now she rides the older man, giving him the taste of some hot pussy that he might have not had in so long.\\n\\nWould he end up traveling with her and experience more of these lustful events? Or will he only put up with it until he finally gets to where he\\'s going? It\\'s a price to pay when you need a way home and gotta ask for a ride, now he\\'s stuck being this young woman play thing as they travel the country and who knows what else they might get into.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Option 3: The bed was rocking back and forth, squeaking and creaking, he had his hands on her beautiful skin as she rocked her hip left and right as she sat on his crotch with him balls deep inside her. She was sitting on him with legs over the edge of the bed as she was texting on her phone, for someone who isn\\'t paying attention she sure did work a cock like if she had full concentration. \\n\\nBut why is she riding this old man\\'s cock so casually? Her job was just to take care of him but surely this isn\\'t one of the proper ways is it? Well lets roll things back a bit to the beginning.\\n\\nShe needed money and landed herself an opportunity to make some extra money doing this, he was the grandfather of one her friends and agreed to help him out around his home. First it was simple stuff like cleaning the house, cooking food, doing laundry, etc. Eventually he made an offer to her for extra money, providing him with extra \"services\" if she caught his drift. She was appalled by his gesture that she would sell herself for money like that and quickly turned down the money because if she\\'s gonna do that it\\'ll be for her own pleasure, not his.\\n\\nNext morning he woke up to find her jerking him off, using her spit and both hands to really work his cock like if she\\'s trying to milk him for every drop he has, next day she was slobbing on his cock as she was sucking the life forces out of him, taking in every inch of his old cock like if it was nothing. Finally it was the final chapter, bouncing that big ass of hers on his cock, showing him how young women do it now as she rode him, shaking her ass on his big old dick, wanting him to cum for her.\\n\\nShe established it quickly that she wasn\\'t gonna have someone tell her when to fuck, she\\'s gonna be the boss around here regardless if he was the one signing her check. Sitting on his face, sucking his cock, filling her with his old cum, doing everything SHE wants to do. This old man thought he could bribe his way into her but ended up getting her for the same pay but is it worth it now that she\\'s taking control? What would you do with a sex crazy woman using your cock for her own selfish needs? Clapping her phat cheeks on his cock, possibly even taking care of his friends as well, perhaps she might be too much to handle, can you last this ride with her?\\n\\n*------------------------*\\n\\n&gt;Older Women: older women helping young men\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Option 1: he was a fat lonely college age nerd, all he had was just his porn and video games but soon it was all going to change. His neighbor, the mother of his high school bully, was a kind woman, she was upset to discover that him and her son were no longer friends and was even more upset that how much of dick her son turned out to be once he left for college. She thought of an idea for her next door neighbor as she went over to his house, sat down and talked to him.\\n\\nShe asked him to come over and visit her later on since his parents are out of town and she\\'s home by herself. She didn\\'t give him any specific instructions on how to dress so he showed up in his casual clothes of sweat pants and a shirt but when he got there he was caught off guard by her walking around naked. He was flabbergasted but it was worse when she walked up to him casually, squatted down while pulling down his pants to suck on his flaccid cock. At first he felt like he should be against it but then again how often will a virgin like him will have an opportunity like this thrown at him?\\n\\nHe didn\\'t have any experience in this kind of stuff so he thought it would be best for her to show him everything, how to touch, how to fuck, how pleasure a woman. She rode him on the couch, bent over the kitchen table for him, sucked him off in the shower, giving him pleasure in more ways than one. She had him feeling like he was living out the porn he would watch in more ways than one, eating out her ass in the park, fucking her in the pool, jerking him off at the movies, hell, she even went with him to a meet up with his friends where they watched him fuck her on the table as they jerked off around her.\\n\\nYou tell me, is this a good way to repay him after all he has been through? Letting him have his way with her huge ass? I think so, especially with him being so built up with lust and cum it wouldn\\'t be a surprise if he just can\\'t stop himself from lusting over her, craving her body, desiring her body, wanting to fill each of her holes with his fat cock and top her off with all of his cum.\\n\\nIt\\'s a dream come true for this big guy, how much would he take advantage of this while her husband is gone? With this much cum built up I\\'m sure he can give her a week worth of lust and possibly more if he plays his cards right, her husband might have a kink fetish and might ask to watch his wife get pounded in front of her.\\n\\n*----------------------------*\\n\\nThese are my limits: underage, bestiality, toilet stuff, gore, abuse, rape, vomit, scat, piss, non-con, basically your usual gross stuff.\\n\\nI am okay with things like sweat and musk to an extent.\\n\\nMy kinks are: Big Booty Women, Hyperspermia, Furry x Human, Interracial, Old Men/Young Woman, Gangbang, Cock/Balls Worship, Anal, Double Penetration, Double Vaginal, Large Cocks (24in. Max For The Fantasy Size Lovers), Normal Size Cocks, Lots of Cum, Pubic Hair, and more.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty open with kinks just as long they\\'re not too wild.',\n",
