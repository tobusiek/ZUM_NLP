It can be attached to keyboards with detachable cables, both Micro USB and Type C versions will be made, as well as non-detachable keyboards using a small adapter, as seen in the photos.\\n\\nIt can be connected to 3 devices and using a keyboard shortcut I can seamlessly switch between them. The battery lasts around 15 hours in this prototype version, but my goal is to achieve 50 hours of continuous use.\\n\\nMultimedia keys are now supported! Volume up/down, play/pause etc., as well as any other multimedia buttons your keyboard may have, for example Browser, Home etc.\\n\\nFeel free to ask my anything in the comments and I'll be happy to answer any question you may have!\\n\\nIf you like this and want to follow the development, you can check my instagram and my youtube below.  \\n[https://www.instagram.com/sterlinghawktech/](https://www.instagram.com/sterlinghawktech/)  \\n[https://www.youtube.com/@SterlingHawkTech](https://www.youtube.com/@SterlingHawkTech)\",\n",

       "  'body': \"1. Dust filters. The less dust gets in your case, the better. Vacuuming the floor around the PC helps. May want to clean the dust off from time to time anyway, as some very small quantities will still get it and accumulate over time.\\n2. Keep liquids off, especially with cases with top mesh or fan opening, but projectile fluids can get in from any direction anyway depending on where you are when you spill them, so just keep the PC somewhere it can't be reached if you spill a coffee. Same goes for mechanical keyboards.\\n3. Keeps pets and children off. Risks are minimal when supervised, but don't underestimate the combined effect of creativity, curiosity and many hours of unsupervised time near the PC. (Kind of like managing room/floor fans with pets and children. The risk is usually low, but you don't want prolonged unsupervised exposure.)\\n4. No CPU installation or any other fragile work when you're tired, sleep, distracted, angry, hurried, jittery, high on caffeine, or after a beer or two. Watch the pins, watch the paste. No hurried jobs. Keep the emotions in check if you need to take the CPU out and put it back in — no more than 2 or 3 unsuccessful attempts in a row is my rule. Treat emotions like responsible drivers treat alcohol. They work kinda the same.\\n5. PSU: You don't have to buy 1200W Titanium, but I wouldn't go below Gold and like 200W surplus. Prefer PSUs that allow you to switch the fan off completely, even manually, to avoid wasting its working hours because PSU fans are a pain to replace. Listen to any new PSU through a vacuum-cleaner pipe or toilet-paper roll to make sure you don't hear coil whine and/or some other nasty sounds. (Do the same acoustic test for GPUs always, and you may want to do it also for soundcards and certain parts of motherboards if you're highly sensitive to sound. But PSU and GPU is kinda mandatory if you're a normal person with the PC case sitting close to where you sit, even several metres/yards).\\n6. This one isn't really about PC health/maintenance, but it comes close and is related: Check manuals and specs and take precise measurements to make sure everything is compatible and there's space for everything. This is less of a problem these days that the stores accept returns more readily but anyway. Don't assume anything, don't rely on calculations based on manual specs if they outcome suggests something like 2mm clearance. Don't brute-force anything unless you really know what you're doing and can manage the financial risk involved.\\n7. The bottom-line takeaway is mostly to avoid doing stupid things or taking stupid risks. Everybody knows this rule, obviously, and mostly follows it, but the difficult task is to control oneself and avoid making exceptions when you're in a hurry or get emotional. **Sticking with the 'don't do stupid' rule 100% of the time as opposed to 99% is the challenge.**\",\n",

Backlight\\n\\n1a. Unless it\\'s plugged in you can\\'t always have the backlight on. If you\\'re plugging it in why buy a wireless keyboard?\\n1b. The timeout of the lights for the keyboards is 30 seconds and this is not changeable. Now I\\'m a developer so sometimes I\\'m just looking at my code and not typing and when I get ready to type if I had my hand on the keyboard I have to press something for the lights to come on. If my hand wasn\\'t on it fine I just need to hover my hand to turn on the lights but that still takes a second.\\n1c. It wouldn\\'t bother me that much if not for a and b but you only get white lights. Sure I typically only use wight or blue static lights but you are spending 100+ on the keyboard the lights don\\'t stay on and it\\'s only white lights that honestly aren\\'t that bright.\\n\\n2.compatibility with other logitech products \\n2a. The receiver is a logibolt which believe it or not does not work with the majority of productivity mice of logitech. Not the mx master or the triathlon I have. Which is fine if you want to use Bluetooth but at work Bluetooth messes up frequently so that means I need 2 recievers as the keyboard is also not compatible with the unifying receiver. Both the unifying receiver and logibolt receiver are things logitech brags about they don\\'t seem to have put to much effort into them.\\n2b. Flow. All the items I\\'ve mentioned are \"compatible\" with logitech flow. The mice \"work\" but do not switch over the keyboard with them most times. It\\'s maddening because I bought a k380 to test flow before this and that works most time but not this keyboard.\\n2c. Easy switch does not switch the mouse. It\\'s another one of those things that you would think would work and when it doesn\\'t you wonder why u stuck with one brand. I\\'m not gonna mention another brand in this comment but I will say there is another low profile mechanical keyboard with multi device that happens to have some orange keycaps exists I\\'ve tested it and I honestly I should have stuck to.\\n\\n3. It\\'s not the best feeling blue switches\\nI can\\'t speak to the other colors (red or brown) because I don\\'t own them but of the 4 mechanical keyboards I own/owned this only really feels better than the $50 one\\n\\n\\nTldr.

I haven't concluded research on this part yet I'm looking forward give it shot. Besides classical keyboard size layout, split layout is delicious relax for my shoulders, arms and hands overall as I have bigger hands than upper average, small keyboards made me bit pain and I had to focus to keep hands close to each other as naturally I have wide shoulders it was pushing me away.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'After a lifetime of my younger brother receiving my hand-me-down PCs as I upgraded, and after years of him not even owning his own PC or even Mac laptop, I decided that PC gaming would be a fun way to reconnect long-distance with him. My original plan was to build myself an upgraded system and give him my current one, but to be honest my current system is more than enough for my needs and meaningfully upgrading would\\'ve been very expensive. Instead, I decided to build him his own with (mostly) all-new hardware. But just to exercise my older brother privilege, I did swap out my PC\\'s PSU for a 750W model and gave him my old 600W one. I\\'m also giving him a spare Dell G-SYNC 144Hz 27\" 1440p monitor that\\'s not very good (TN panel, bad viewing angles), but will be replacing it with my Acer Predator 27\" 144Hz GSYNC monitor once my Dough Spectrum OLED arrives to replace it.\\n\\nTo make up for the hand-me-downs, I supplied a custom-built, hand-lubed mechanical keyboard, a new Logitech mouse, and an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller.\\n\\n**Parts Summary:**\\n\\n* Velkase Velka 7 (6.9L) v2.1 case w/ PCIe 4.0 riser cable\\n* Gigabyte B550I AORUS Pro AX ITX motherboard (Rev 1.2)\\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600 CPU (PBO undervolted, -20 offset all cores, +200MHz)\\n* 32GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3600 CL16 RAM\\n* Alpenföhn Black Ridge CPU cooler, w/ swapped Noctua NF-A9x14 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) fan\\n* MSI Ventus 2x RTX 4070 OC, deshrouded + 2x Noctua NF-A12x15 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) fans\\n* 2TB Western Digital SN770 SSD\\n* Corsair SF600 80Plus Platinum PSU\\n* Keychron Q2 Pro keyboard in e-white, w/ Keychron K Pro Silent Brown switches (hand-lubed by me), orange &amp; white PBT dye-sub keycaps\\n* Kraken keyboards aviator-style orange  coiled USB-C cable\\n* Logitch G PRO X Superlight mouse\\n* Microsoft Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller + the Elite Series 2 accessory kit (carrying case, paddles, replacement D-pad, charger, etc.)\\n\\n**The Build:**\\n\\nI previously built my gaming PC in an NCase M1 v6.1 with very similar parts (earlier revision of the same motherboard, a 5600X, same RAM, and a leftover 1080 that I later replaced with a 3080 12GB after GPU prices came down last year), which was the first time I\\'d built anything in the ITX/SFF arena. I guess I got bit by the bug, because I can\\'t imagine building in a full-size case again, at least for this sort of machine. Building SFF is just too much fun!\\n\\nI decided for this machine I wanted to go even smaller than the NCase\\'s nearly 13L while still maintaining reasonable thermals, and without saddling my brother with significantly worse performance than my own PC. Although I feel NVIDIA\\'s RTX 4070 is not the best value at $600, the efficiency bump it represented over my own 3080 12GB while maintaining equivalent performance seemed like the perfect GPU to fit into an even smaller case. I was originally looking at the Velka 5, but it was out of stock pending a refresh, and the requirement of the Flex-ATX power supply struck me as non-ideal for noise. So I went for the Velka 7, which at a scant 5.9L was still by far the smallest case I\\'d ever built in, but I felt would offer a good balance between diminutive size and decent noise/thermals.\\n\\nI also decided to stick with Zen 3 because the Alpenföhn Black Ridge doesn\\'t support the new AM5 socket mounting mechanism, and because going with Zen 3 parts allowed me to save considerably on all the core parts; the CPU, motherboard, and RAM were all notably cheaper by sticking with the previous generation, and at 1440p I don\\'t think going bleeding edge is really necessary.\\n\\nThe build itself was very fun, albeit a bit challenging given the tight spaces involved. I had to remove both the motherboard\\'s backplate and the M.2 heatsink included with the board to avoid interference with the PCIe riser cable routing and the CPU cooler\\'s fan, respectively. And the process of actually getting the assembled \"compute brick\" (what I\\'ve taken to calling the sandwich-layout motherboard + GPU assembly) inside the case took a bit of finagling, with all the display extension cables needing to be pre-plugged and routed prior to installation. That said, I wouldn\\'t describe it as painful by any stretch, and the case is quite well made.\\n\\nThe last tricky bit was the GPU. Having had great luck with de-shrouding my 3080 12GB in the NCase and using two bottom-mounted Noctua NF-A12x25s to cool it effectively and quietly, I wanted to try a similar thing with this GPU. Despite having a maximum power draw of only 200W vs my 3080\\'s 350W, I suspected using 2x 120mm fans, albeit slim ones, would still allow for much quieter cooling than the 2-slot card\\'s native shroud and fans. I was so confident about this I didn\\'t even test the card\\'s own cooler, I just took it off before ever powering it on. I also initially zip-tied the fans to the side panel, which made installation a little tricky and wound up with little zip-ties sticking out of the side panel.\\n\\nInitially, I had both fans plugged into the GPU\\'s on-board header with a CRJ micro 4-pin PWM dual fan splitter. However, I found that for whatever reason, the on-board fan controller wouldn\\'t spin the two fans any slower than 1300RPM. While not exactly *loud*, I wouldn\\'t describe that speed as \"quiet\" either. Annoyed, I slapped a couple LNA adapters between the splitter and the fans, which weirdly made zero difference. They spun up slower, but the card still insisted on running them at 1300RPM minimum. Annoyed, I pulled them out and put the stock cooler back on the card for testing. While it wasn\\'t annoyingly loud, it was still louder than I wanted.\\n\\nEncouraged by some online friends to try out FanControl, I again removed the stock GPU cooler and re-installed the fans, this time connecting them via a fan cable + splitter routed from the motherboard\\'s \"System 1\" header around to the GPU side of the case. Immediately I was able to spin them down as low as a scant 250RPM, which was completely inaudible. After more testing and tweaking, I found a great balance between effective cooling performance and acceptably quiet noise levels. I also found that I was able to simply pressure-fit the fans between the GPU and the side panel, and while I probably wouldn\\'t trust that for shipping in the mail, they seem perfectly stable for \"sitting on a desk\" duty.\\n\\nMy last tweaking test was to see if reversing the GPU fans from intake to exhaust would help pull a little extra hot air from the CPU side of the case via overall negative pressure. However, unfortunately because of the design of the Noctua fans and the GPU\\'s heatsink not going from fan corner to fan corner, the lower fan\\'s blades interfered with the heatsink and stopped spinning. So I\\'m stuck with intake, since the exhaust side has a built-in grille which protects the fan blades, and the intake side has all four rubber pads making contact with the side panel.\\n\\n**Thermal Performance:**\\n\\nAs a \\\\~6L case, the Velka 7 doesn\\'t have a whole lot of room to breathe, especially on the CPU side. CPU temps are correspondingly warm, typically stabilizing in the 72–75°C range during gaming loads. All-core CPU heavy activity can push the CPU up to 80°C at its 77W power limit, though as a gaming-focused system I doubt this will be much of a concern most of the time. Even this is well below TJMax.\\n\\nGPU temperatures are much nicer. The 4070\\'s low power draw is made even lower by a so-far rock solid stable 2640MHz @ 910mV undervolt, with Unigine\\'s Superposition benchmark sitting around 132W draw and 65°C, with the two Noctua fans whirring quietly at a sedate 1055RPM. Real-time ray tracing benchmarks can push the power draw up to 160W, with the fans getting slightly more audible in the 1100RPM range and temperatures sitting closer to 69°C (nice).',\n",

       "  'body': 'The best keyboard for you is the one you like most. A keyboard won’t improve your skill in game. Going from a membrane keyboard to mechanical may give you a slight improvement since the force required to press a key is lower on mechanical keyboards (usually). \\n\\nThe general consensus is that linear switches are best for gaming. Most keyboards come with the option of linear, tactile, and clicky. But the best switch is the one you like most. The switches are the primary thing that changes the way a keyboard feels, not the keyboard itself, so I’d recommend going to Best Buy or micro center or somewhere like that to test out some keyboards and decide what feels best to you. If you want the absolute lowest possible latency, look for optical switches. But just so you know the difference will be basically imperceivable from a regular switch.\\n\\nSome recommendations I would give are anything by Keychron, they’re inexpensive and consistently good quality. I’d also recommend getting one with hot swap sockets so you can change the switches out to try different types. \\n\\nIf you have some more money to spend, the Glorious GMMK Pro is a high quality, highly customizable board. \\n\\nAnd there’s a lot more that aren’t from traditional gaming brands. In my experience you can get a lot more quality for your money if you stay away from the big brands like Corsair, Logitech and Asus.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'As part of a writing floating the notion that Littlefinger has Hoare blood — (see [[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/12ofe7x/a_gold_ship_silver_chains_littlefinger_the_sigil/) — I discussed how each aspect of House Hoare\\'s sigil might hint that Littlefinger is a Hoare, noting that Littlefinger himself does something similar vis-a-vis Orton Merryweather and his sigil:\\n&gt;Petyr had once remarked that the horn of plenty that adorned House Merryweather\\'s arms suited Lord Orton admirably, since he had carrot-colored hair, a nose as bulbous as a beetroot, and pease porridge for wits. *(AFFC Cersei IV)*\\n\\nHere, I want to delve further into my suspicion that the \"gold longship on black\" portion of the Hoare sigil is (at least in some significant part) a reference to the [[*S.S. Central America* a.k.a. \"The Ship of Gold\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Central_America)].\\n\\nThe so-called Ship of Gold was a gold-laden ship that was sunk in 1857 in a storm 200 miles off the Carolina coast and lost 8000 feet down in the inky-black depths of the Atlantic Ocean until it was located in 1987 by an upstart team of young treasure hunters from Columbus, Ohio (of all places) led by a guy named Tommy Thompson. I suspect that Littlefinger\\'s character and in some ways his story may have been inspired in some significant part — although not entirely or even primarily — by the story of Thompson and the recovery of the sunken treasure from that ship as it was known c. 1995, when GRRM began writing *AGOT*. At bare minimum, I think GRRM recognized the resonances between the story of Thompson and the Ship of Gold and Littlefinger\\'s story by the time he designed the sigil of House Hoare (which was done c. May 1999, per my direct correspondance with Linda Antonsson).\\n\\nIf I\\'m right that Littlefinger has Hoare blood and Targaryen blood, his story is in some sense that of a man attempting to reclaim and recover what he may see as lost wealth and power (including that of the Hoares) that is rightfully his, right? There is a \"rhyme\" between this idea and that of recovering a long-lost treasure from the ocean floor. Especially because the story of the \"Ship of Gold\" as it stood c. 1995 involved a high-profile court battle for possession of the treasure between the clever young media-savvy treasure hunters who found, recovered and claimed the lost gold by right of abandonment and discovery — and who did everything they could to win the public\\'s support as adventuring heroes on a quest for a storybook treasure — and the legal \"heirs\" of the parties who held the rights to the gold after the ship was sunk in 1857 and sought to, from their perspective, *re*-claim via argument what they said was rightly theirs.\\n\\nThe finding of the Ship of Gold was big news when it was first announced in 1987, and bigger news when substantial gold was recovered in 1989. Database searches show headlines in hundreds of papers, and I have vague memories of television news coverage which I at present have no way to confirm. (I did find a Tonight Show appearance by one of the members of Thomspon\\'s crew [[on youtube](https://youtu.be/Det4qrOXvxE)].)\\n\\nThe \"Ship of Gold\" continued to make news in the early 90s as bunch of insurance companies — the legal \"heirs\" of the original insurers of the 1857 ship and its cargo of gold — sued the treasure finders, claiming the recovered treasure was actually theirs by rights. See e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/07/18/treasure-hunters-claim-450-million-shpwreck/5b2d53be-f770-4561-b514-5247b2e50777/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/14/storybook-treasure-found-off-south-carolina/e59459ac-31d6-4546-a482-18aaad62dafe/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/10/06/treasure-hunters-golden-moment/98812bc7-abc9-4b9f-abec-e51f5a97b811/, https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2014/10/21/treasure-hunt-on-high-seas/9315335007/, https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/us/a-treasure-from-the-seas-but-whose.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/08/15/the-law-of-finders-keepers/716ca9f2-6c80-4410-bb06-4a66000a4582/, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/28/us/insurers-to-share-shipwreck-s-gold.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/03/23/sunken-treasure-bounty-to-be-shared-with-heirs/a1ae96c9-d9c9-4e46-843e-bafda4071c88/, and especially this 1993 story, which alludes to and quotes some of the massive contemporaneous press coverage: https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19930627-1993-06-27-9306270057-story.html.

It opens with the tale of the Ship of Gold sinking in a storm in the fall of 1857:\\n&gt;A week out of Panama, on her 44th trip to New York, the *Central America* rounded the Flordia Keys and **ran smack in to a horrendous hurricane.**\\n\\nIsn\\'t curious, then, that there\\'s a \"throwaway\" line in *ASOS Tyrion VI* in which Tyrion wishes that Littlefinger\\'s ship would \"r[u]n into a storm at sea and s[i]nk\"?\\n&gt;He wondered if Petyr Baelish had reached the Vale yet. If the gods are good, he **ran into a storm at sea and sank.** But when had the gods ever been especially good?\\n\\nEspecially when Littlefinger\\'s *Merling King* is (as I argued in my main post discussing the Hoare sigil) a kind of \"Ship of Gold\", in that it transports \"Arbor Gold\" to the Vale.\\n\\n##Ship Insurance &amp; Wreckers\\nIf any one thing makes me truly *believe* that GRRM has written *ASOIAF* with the Ship of Gold saga in mind, it\\'s that *ADWD* \"just so happens\" to foreground two seemingly obscure notions, both of which are absolutely central elements of the \"Ship of Gold\" saga: (1) ship\\'s insurance and (2) \"wreckers\" who recover the wealth of shipwrecks.\\n\\nThe headline-making lawsuits about the Ship of Gold were all about a bunch of insurance companies — the heirs of the companies that sold ship\\'s insurance related to the *S.S. Central America* — suing the plucky storybook-come-true treasure finders. The insurance companies were pretty thoroughly villainized in the media.\\n\\nIn *ADWD The Ugly Little Girl,* Arya kills a man who insures ship\\'s cargos but doesn\\'t pay off when a shipwreck happens, and in *ADWD Tyrion VII* it\\'s mentioned that \"Vogarro\\'s whore\" (sounds like Hoare!) — a fabulously wealthy woman of low-birth whose business operations seem as variegated as those of the poor-boy-made-good Littlefinger — \"insured shipowners\". What a strange thing to repeatedly bring up in a fantasy novel… *unless* you\\'re riffing on a real-life story that involved ship\\'s insurance.\\n\\nAlso in *ADWD* — in *Davos I* — Davos visits the \"robber lord and wrecker\" Lord Borrell in Sisteron on Sweetsister. The entire story of the Ship of Gold was triggered, of course, by a wrecker (in the more benign sense of \"a person or vessel employed in recovering salvage from wrecked or disabled vessels\"), Thompson, finding the wreck of all wrecks. To the insurance companies, of course, he was a \"robber\", but to most of the public, the insurance companies challenging Thompson\\'s claim in court were, in effect, \"robber lords\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth nothing that GRRM paints both the wreckers—\\n&gt;The beacons that burned along the shores of the Three Sisters were supposed to warn of shoals and reefs and rocks and lead the way to safety, but on stormy nights and foggy ones, some Sistermen would use false lights to draw unwary captains to their doom. *(ADWD Davos I)*\\n\\n—and insurers—\\n&gt;\"He is writing each a binder. If their ships are lost in a storm or taken by pirates, he promises to pay them for the value of the vessel and all its contents.\" … \"No doubt many a captain sinking in a storm has taken some small solace in his binder back in Braavos, knowing that his widow and children will not want.\" A sad smile touched his lips. \"It is one thing to write such a binder, though, and another to make good on it.\" *(ADWD The Ugly Little Girl)*\\n\\n—as shady operators. Like Littlefinger, then.\\n\\n##Pirates! Littlefingerian Pirates!\\n&gt;Two hundred miles off the Carolina coast, on the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream (they will tell you this much, but no more, for even in the 1990s they worry about pirates)… *(Life Magazine \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\")*\\n\\nThe colorful media coverage often mentioned potential piracy — recall that \"the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves\" *(ASOS Samwell V)* — both literal (in terms of competing salvage teams trying to loot the wreck after it was located) and more figurative, i.e. of a type that \"rhymes\" with the type of pen-and-ink-and-bullshit \"war\" Littlefinger likes to conduct:\\n&gt;Now that they\\'d rescued the treasure, the explorers were taking no chances — potential pirates lurked at every turn.\\n\\n&gt;By now, however, they felt that \"pirates\" of another sort — not with swords and eye patches, but with ties and legal briefs — posed the real threat. *(Newport News Daily Press June 26, 1993 \"Tarnished Treasure\", linked above)*\\n\\nWhen courts found in favor of the insurance companies, it was not a popular decision, and these legal \"heirs\" were denounced as \"pirates\":\\n&gt;Editorial writers across the country denounced the decision.\\n\\n&gt;\"Ah, the ancient call of the open sea, in the days when men were men and Blackbeard sailed the bounding main!\" the Oakland Tribune wrote. \"Alas, there are landlubbing pirates afoot these days who would make Captain Hook look limp-hooked. They are called lawyers and insurers.\"\\n\\n&gt;Another editorial writer saw the insurance lawyers as \"pirates in pinstripes.\" *(ibid.)*\\n\\nOf course, from the perspective of the insurance companies and ultimately the courts (at least to a degree — see below), the real and far more literal pirate was Tommy Thompson. His group found the treasure, and he fought tooth and nail in court to keep it with no claim to title other than \"finders keepers\". From the perspective of the wealthy, powerful insurance establishment (and ultimately the legal establishment — at least technically), Thompsons\\'s refusal to return *any* of the treasure to its legal \"heirs\" was itself something of an act of ironborn-ish piracy itself. (Think here about Littlefinger wrangling with the old money Vale establishment.)\\n\\n(Interestingly, one of the insurance companies\\' public-facing lawyers arguing in 1991 that her clients had never abandoned the treasure nor their claims to it — Thompson\\'s side was arguing they *had* de facto abandoned it, making it up for grabs — was named… Mary**lyn** **Little**. [See: Lyn Corbray &amp; Littlefinger.] Is it possible GRRM read or saw her quoted on some TV news report about the affair, and thus that her name had some inspirational role? Doubtful, but tantalizing.)\\n\\nI think GRRM wrote Littlefinger (in part) with *both* parties to the conflict over the Ship of Gold in mind. The insurance companies were fighting for the rights of \"heirs\" using lawyerly \"piracy\" (piracy being synonomous with the ironborn), and Hoare-y Littlefinger sees himself as heir to multiple legacies and fights to regain them using similar pen-and-ink-and-bullshit. At the same time, Thompson was selling himself as the romantic figure Littlefinger longed to be as a child (when he played at being the Prince of Dragonflies) and more than a bit of a pirate himself (and that\\'s before more recent developments), and Littlefinger was written with him in mind, too.\\n\\nWhile Hoare-y Littlefinger adopts something like the legalistic tactics of the \"pirates in pinstripes\" denounced by the media, his story \"rhymes\" in a slew of way with that of the treasure-finder, Tommy Thompson, as it was told in the media at the time.\\n\\n##Abandoned Treasure, Abandoned Castle\\nThompson based his entire claim to the treasure on the fact that the insurance companies had demonstrably \"abandoned\" their claims to it. How does Littlefinger come to be Lord of Harrenhal, ancestral seat of House Hoare? Lady Whent abandoned it. (In multiple senses, actually.)\\n&gt;**Lady Whent** had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully, but she\\'d used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers, and **let the rest go to ruin. Now she was fled**… *(ACOK Arya VII)*\\n\\n\\n##Finders Keepers &amp; Squatter\\'s Rights\\nReporting on the court battle over Thompson\\'s find universally made reference to the principle of \"finders keepers\" following the initial lower court ruling in Thompson\\'s favor. \"Finders keepers\" seems in a way analogous to Littlefinger\\'s strategy vis-a-vis the Eyrie. He\\'s essentially trying to take it using something that\\'s not far removed from squatter\\'s rights: having gotten his toe in the door at the previous owner\\'s invitation, he subsequently refuses to leave. It\\'s very close to \"I found it, it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\n\\n##Not Without A Fight\\nWhere Thompson refused to give up the treasure he\\'d found to the insurance companies without a fight—\\n&gt;Thompson… wasn\\'t about to fling his hard-earned gold to the whims of the sea. He was going to fight. *(\"Tarnished Treasure\")*\\n\\n—Littlefinger found his \"treasure\", Cat—\\n&gt;There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me . . . but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. But she gave me something finer, a gift a woman can give but once. *(ASOS Sansa V)*\\n\\n—and refused to give her up to the scion of a much more powerful House without a fight. Nor, like Thompson in court, did he give up when hard-pressed by a seemingly superior, wealthy and powerful foe:\\n&gt;\"Yield!\" [Brandon] called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly. *(AGOT Catelyn VII)*\\n\\n##Battle Scars\\nLittlefinger was scarred in his fight with Brandon:\\n&gt;\"I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr\\'s life. He let him off with a scar.\" *-Catelyn (AGOT Catelyn IV)*\\n\\nThe lengthy, pirate-heavy, 1993 newspaper account of the story I\\'ve been quoting said this of Thompson:\\n&gt;As yet another court date approaches, Thompson admits to battle scars.\\n\\n(Given the way Thompson\\'s PR machine worked, it\\'s likely this was a narrative actively sold by Thompson, and thus something that may have been repeated in TV news and magazine show accounts and in other news and print magazine stories not easily accessible.)\\n\\n##Losing the Battle, Winning the War\\nLittlefinger lost his duel to Brandon, but (I believe) ultimately \"won the war\" by baiting Brandon into riding to his death in King\\'s Landing and by subsequently leveraging Lysa\\'s love into his current situation.\\n\\nThompson\\'s 1992 and 1993 legal \"losses\" to the insurance companies claiming the gold he found was theirs was analogous: While the Court of Appeals technically overruled a lower court and sided with the insurance companies, it also stipulated that Thompson\\'s group should still \"receive by far the largest share of the treasure\" and sent the case back for a lower court to determine the amount. In November 1993 an Admiralty court ruled that Thompson would get at least 90%. The ruling was upheld by the US Court of Appeals in June 1995 (long before GRRM finished writing *AGOT* in mid-1996) — one headline read \"Finders, (Mostly) Keepers\" — and the Supreme Court turned down a further appeal that October, definitively rendering the insurance companies\\' initial court victory pyrrhic and seemingly making Thompson, like Littlefinger, the ultimate winner.\\n\\n##Nerds vs. Cowboys, A Letter Writer vs. Knights\\nFrom early on the narrative sold to the world by Thompson using Ken Ringle of *The Washington Post* and the *Post\\'s* wire service—\\n&gt;Onto the scene… sailed… a low-profile shipload of computer-happy technocrats from Columbus, Ohio. In the ocean cowboy world of treasure hunters, their success story reads like the script for \"Revenge of the Nerds.\"\\n*([Washington Post - 9.14.1989 - \\'STORYBOOK TREASURE\\' FOUND OFF SOUTH CAROLINA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/14/storybook-treasure-found-off-south-carolina/e59459ac-31d6-4546-a482-18aaad62dafe/))*\\n\\n—is notably reminiscent of the story of Littlefinger transcending his provinical origins, his defeat by macho thug Brandon, and his exile to the Fingers at the hands of the knight and village-razer Hoster Tully to rise high using his wits in a world dominated by might and the sword.\\n\\n##Defiance, Ohio &amp; The Middle Finger\\nLittlefinger was of \"undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight\", \"a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets\" from a provincial backwater call \"The Fingers\". *(ACOK Tyrion IV; ASOS Sansa VI)* He\\'s from \"the the smallest of the Fingers\", which a look at the map suggests is in the same position as the middle finger (noting the \"thumb\" nub to the north) and which I suspect we\\'ll learn is *called* \"the Middle Finger\". Why? Because as we read in press accout after press account, Thompson, who couldn\\'t read until third grade, who flunked math and science tests in high school in high school, and who graduated from an unheralded midwestern state school where he was the only engineering student studying ocean engineering — i.e. who at least superficially had what we might call an \"undistinguished\" background before finding what was heralded as the greatest lost treasure ever — grew up in the tiny, rural backwater of *Defiance,* Ohio. Get it? Middle Finger. Defiance.\\n\\n(After first writing the foregoing paragraph a couple months ago, I realized that the \"Journeys\" map in the GRRM-approved *Lands of Ice &amp; Fire\" set confirms that the \"middle finger\" I suspected was Littlefinger\\'s *is* indeed where his tower is located.) \\n\\n(See also Littlefinger defying Brandon telling him to yield, defying the Vale lords, etc.)\\n\\n##Clever, Young, Creative Gold-Finders\\nEarly press accounts described Thompson in terms that are in many ways positively Littlefingerian: As a child, Thompson had been \"a precocious boy\". He built a working telephone when he was 8. *Life* began its profile of Thompson like this:\\n&gt;Tommy Thompson wasn\\'t like other boys growing up in Defiance, Ohio, in the 1960s. While his classmates were off slugging baseballs and imagining themselves to be Ted Williams [see: Brandon the \"jock\"], \"Tommy was always dragging home neighbors\\' junk from the alley — old TVs, radios, motors — and coming up with new inventions,\" remembers his sister Sandee Butterworth [shades of Butterwell, whose tourney in *The Mystery Knight* \"rhymes\" deeply with Littlefinger\\'s upcoming tourney at the Gates of the Moon]. But this wasn\\'t just another post-Sputnik nerd in the making.\\n\\nNow lauded by his investors as \"a great intellect\" and \"one of the smartest guys I ever met\", he was part of a group of \"young entrepreneurs\", and he and the team he put together showed \"creativity and entrepreneurship aplenty\" to \"far outrun\" older, competing salvage firms and find the lost Ship of God.\\n\\nAll that seems quite Littlefingerian:\\n&gt;\"I knew he would rise high,\" Catelyn said. \"He was always clever, even as a boy…\" *(AGOT Catelyn IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;[Lysa:] \"My father said he was too lowborn, but I knew how high he\\'d rise. Jon gave him the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when he increased the incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever he was and gave him other appointments, even brought him to King\\'s Landing to be master of coin.\" *(ASOS Sansa VI)*\\n***\\n&gt;[Littlefinger] moved his own men into place. … They were men of middling birth, by and large… but judging from their results, **far more able than their highborn predecessors.** *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n(Both Tullys speak of him \"rising high\". Obviously this foreshadows him taking over the Eyrie, per its height and the Arryns\\' words \"As High As Honor\", but \"rising high\" could also be seen as the inverse of *diving deep,* which Thompson had to do to find the wreck of the Ship of Gold on the deep sea floor, 8000 feet down.)\\n\\nBut the most obvious \"rhyme\" between Thompson and Littlefinger is that Thompson achieved fame because he found a bunch of gold. And Littlefinger? Same.\\n&gt;Littlefinger was… [a] clever… man, …always able to find[!] whatever gold the king or his Hand required… *(ACOK IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;\"The master of coin finds[!] the money.\" *-Littlefinger (AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;Littlefinger had been more use at court. He had a gift for finding[!] gold… *(AFFC Cersei IV)*\\n\\n\\n##Romantic Dreamers\\nThere was another angle to much of the coverage of Thompson, though. In addition to being a *clever* child, he was portrayed as a *dreamer*. The next sentence of above-quoted *Life* magazine profile pivoted from his childhood capacity for invention to his childhood imagination:\\n&gt;Though land-locked, Tommy and his buddy Barry Schatz often dreamed together about sea adventures, about the mysteries of what might be found on the floor of the ocean.\\n\\nA 1993 piece painted Thompson\\'s desire to *get fucking rich* as product of a boyhood \"love of the sea\" that included visions of \"scouring sunken ships\" for \"aging artifacts . . . perhaps even treasure\".\\n\\nThis compares to Littlefinger playing at the Prince of Dragonflies:\\n&gt;\"We\\'re all just songs in the end. If we are lucky.\" She had played at being Jenny that day, had even wound flowers in her hair. And Petyr had pretended to be her Prince of Dragonflies. Catelyn could not have been more than twelve, Petyr just a boy. *(ASOS Catelyn V)*\\n\\n\\n##Littlefinger &amp; Thompson Do P.R.\\nIn fact, Thompson waged a massively successful, \"carefully crafted high-profile media campaign\" to plant stories like this and garner coverage that painted him as a romantic hero fighting for the little guy. As *Forbes* put it much later:\\n&gt;Thompson always controlled the information flow. *([Forbes \"Ship of Fools\"](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0619/158.html?sh=40a6fd417dd9))*\\n\\nConsider in this regard Thompson\\'s quote in the wake of the US Court of Appeals decision finding for the insurance companies:\\n&gt;\"Only through our efforts has the lost legend of the S.S. Central America been rediscovered, the treasure-hunting group\\'s founder, Thomas G. Thompson, said in a statement. \"It saddens me to think it could be possible that a group of the largest insurance companies in the world could be awarded the treasure we worked so hard to find and recover.\" *(https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/28/us/insurers-to-share-shipwreck-s-gold.html)*\\n\\nLittlefinger is a little guy who plays at the romantic idea of being the Prince of Dragonflies and who jokes about cultivating a dastardly image while being a romantic using language reminiscent of Thompson\\'s, above:\\n&gt;Petyr Baelish smiled. \"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and **I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.**\" *(AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n\\nBut Littlefinger is acutely aware of the importance of public perception as Thompson was when he waged his successful PR campaign to paint his salvage mission as the fulfillment of romantic childhood dreams and fantasies about \"scouring sunken ships\" for \"aging artifacts . . . perhaps even treasure\". To wit, recall that he advises Cersei to launch what is in effect a P.R./media campaign regarding the rumors of her incest:\\n&gt;Petyr Baelish steepled his fingers. \"If we attempt to silence this talk, we only lend it credence. Better to treat it with contempt, like the pathetic lie it is. And meantime, fight fire with fire. … A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. … [If] we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold, well . . . the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon.\" *(ACOK Tyrion III)*\\n\\n##Littlefinger &amp; Thompson: Master Jugglers. (Also: Swan? *Again?*)\\nIn one anecdote, Thompson talks about how as a kid he built a lawn mower with four engines that pulled \"three rotary mowers\":\\n\"The problem was keeping all four engines running at once.\" [said Thompson] *(https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2014/10/21/treasure-hunt-on-high-seas/9315335007/)*\\n\\nKeeping a bunch of engines driving whirling blades all running at once? I can\\'t help but think of this:\\n&gt;A master juggler was Petyr Baelish. *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n—coupled with this:\\n&gt;A juggler kept a half-dozen swords and axes whirling through the air as skewers of blood sausage were brought sizzling to the tables, a juxtaposition that Tyrion thought passing clever, though not perhaps in the best of taste. *(ASOS Tyrion VIII)*\\n\\nEspecially because of the lines *immediately* preceding that last Tyrion quote:\\n&gt;\"Then came some strolling pipers and clever dogs and sword swallowers, with buttered pease, chopped nuts, and slivers of swan poached in a sauce of saffron and peaches. (**\"Not swan again,\"** Tyrion muttered, remembering his supper with his sister on the eve of battle.) *(ASOS Tyrion VIII)*\\n\\nWhy is Tyrion expressing that he\\'s sick of eating swan interesting to me? Because one of the Thompson\\'s other favorite PR-tested anecdotes was to talk about one of the hardships he\\'d endured while looking for the Ship of Gold: at one point having to eat fried chicken for every single meal for weeks on end. \"Not chicken again\" could\\'ve been his motto.\\n\\n\\n##Tinkerer &amp; Tinkers\\nAnother big PR talking point (we can infer) was that Thompson had always been a \"**tinkerer**\". A single 1989 profile quoted him as saying \"I was always a tinkerer\", talked about the remaining gold waiting for him \"to come back and start tinkering again\", and finally referred to him as \"the inveterate tinkerer\".\\n\\nThere\\'s only *one* use of anything like that term in the *ASOIAF* canon, and it\\'s smack in the middle of a passage—\\n&gt;In Volantis **he had seen the galleys taking on provisions. The whole city had seemed drunk. Sailors and soldiers and tinkers[!] had been observed dancing in the streets with nobles and fat merchants, and in every inn and winesink cups were being raised** to the new triarchs. **All the talk had been of the gold and gems** and slaves **that would flood into Volantis** once the dragon queen was dead. One day of such reports was all that Victarion Greyjoy could stomach; **he paid the gold price** for food and water, though it shamed him, and took his ships back out to sea. *(ADWD The Iron Suitor)*\\n\\n—that describes a scene suspiciously akin to the celebration when Thompson\\'s salvage ship returned to port with the first load of gold from the Ship of Gold, as reported in that same magazine profile on Thompson that called him a tinkerer three times and also by *The Washington Post*.\\n\\nThe \"nobles and fat merchants\" who seemed drunk and who were \"dancing in the streets\" seem like a riff on the \"cheering crowd of [Thompson\\'s] financial backers\" who were there waiting for him when his crew returned to port in 1989 — \"some of Central Ohio\\'s wealthiest citizens gathered to clap their hands\".\\n\\nWhere Victarion thinks \"the whole city… seemed drunk\", it seems like \"the whole city\" of Norfolk turned out to greet Thompson and company: we read about a \"cheering crowd\", a \"brass-band welcome\" from a local high school band, police, federal marshals, and a media circus. The *WaPo* article includes an anecdote which seems like grist for GRRM\\'s description of Volantis:\\n&gt;Genevieve Gross of North Olmsted, Ohio, the great-great-niece of Alvin Ellis, one of the 423 passengers lost on the *Central America,* **thanked the city of Norfolk for its kindness** to Ellis\\'s widow when she was put ashore here with other survivors without a penny to her name. **The city showered her with food and clothing, Gross said, the hotel where she landed waived her bill, and the innkeeper presented her with more than $700 in gold to help her when she left.**\\n\\nIt\\'s almost as if \"the whole city had [*been*] drunk\".\\n\\n*Immediately* before Victarion describes Volantis, drunk on talk of the gold that would soon \"flood into\" town (an approriate term if this is indeed a wink at the Ship of Gold coverage!), he declares in response to Wulfe\\'s proposal that \"another day [delay] might mean more another ship\" to add to the fleet:\\n&gt;\"Aye. And ten days might mean ten ships, or none at all. We have squandered too many days waiting on the sight of sails. Our victory will be that much the sweeter if we win it with a smaller fleet.\"\\n\\nIt just so happens that the *WaPo* piece about the cheering welcome party for Thompson talks of a similar number of days \"squandered\":\\n&gt;**The group lost more than a week** of operational work to Hurricane Hugo…\\n\\nAnd Victarion\\'s logic (a \"sweeter\" victory \"with a smaller fleet\") mirrors that of Thompson, who did what he did as a small, upstart firm, outracing other, far larger, established salvage firms to find the *Central America* with his single ship.\\n\\nAll that, right in the one and only spot where GRRM uses \"tinker\" — a key motif in Thompson\\'s carefully crafted, PR-deployed myth-making.\\n\\n\\n##Low-Profile Whiz Kids!\\nThe lede of *The Washington Post\\'s* PR-engineered July 18, 1987 story breaking the news of the find (\"TREASURE HUNTERS CLAIM $450 MILLION SHPWRECK\") spoke in breathless terms about the nous of Thompson\\'s team:\\n&gt;A partnership of low-profile treasure hunters, operating on the outer edge of ocean engineering technology, has laid claim to what it believes to be one of America\\'s most historic shipwrecks, a paddle-wheel steamer sunk in 1857 with some $450 million in gold coins from the California Gold Rush.\\n\\nAgain there\\'s an echo of Littlefinger\\'s supposed brilliance here. \"The outer edge of ocean engineering technology!\" Golly, it\\'s practically magic!\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the \"low-profile\" bit. In a lot of ways this recalls Tyrion\\'s description of Littlefinger skating by, under everybody\\'s radar:\\n&gt;No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone\\'s friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage. *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n##Mud\\nThe same article described the location in which the Ship of Gold was found as \"a vast, virtually featureless undersea mud flat\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth nothing that Littlefinger has a curious association with mud:\\n&gt;[Catelyn] remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\\'d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. *(AGOT Catelyn V)*\\n\\nCould that be a wink? It certainly seems like a metaphor for Littlefinger\\'s greed, which would fit.\\n\\n##Star Trek! The Wizard of Oz! \\nWhen the same *WaPo* shill/reporter wrote another feature on September 14, 1989 after being granted exclusive access to Thompson\\'s salvage ship when it began recovery operations, the language was exactly the kind of stuff that would attract a nerd like GRRM\\'s attention. I already quoted the \"Revenge of the Nerds\" language. There\\'s also a *Star Trek* reference:\\n&gt;It is driven from a control room in the bowels of this vessel, which, with its blinking monitors, glowing dials and multiple computer keyboards, could double for the cockpit of the starship Enterprise. \\n\\n(The 1992 *Life* story doubles up on the Star Trek bit, making me think this was another heavily manufactured angle. Thompson\\'s ship is said to have \"workmanlike gray decks\" but \"Stark Trek guts\" containing \"a wondrous world of technology\".)\\n\\nWe get a fantastic image of \"a mechanical Victorian dowager at underwater tea\", and a Wizard of Oz reference—\\n&gt;Working in a lightly silted area of the wreck they hadn\\'t touched before, they used Nemo\\'s water thrusters to blow away the underwater dust and suddenly saw what some aboard are already calling \"the yellow brick road.\"\\n\\n—which prefigures *ASOIAF* referencing the Wicked Witch of the West/East when \"Lady Olenna\\'s nasty little smile\" reminds Cersei of wicked witchy Maggi (from the Westerlands via Essos) while reminding *us* of a guy with an Olenna-esque \"nasty grin\" saying, improbably, \"my pretties\":\\n&gt;The third was armed only with a nasty grin. \"And where are you lot bound, my pretties?\" he asked. *(TWOW Arianne II)*\\n\\nAll that language could have sucked GRRM in.\\n\\n##\"Storybook Treasure In A Kid\\'s Book\"\\nThe most obvious GRRM-bait and *ASOIAF* tie-in, though, is the story\\'s headline — \\'STORYBOOK TREASURE\\' FOUND OFF SOUTH CAROLINA — and Thompson being quoted saying:\\n&gt;It\\'s just like a storybook treasure in a kid\\'s book.\\n\\nThis was a practiced line. The 1992 *Life* feature seemingly quotes Thompson\\'s apparently contemporanous description/log as the treasure was first being revealed by undersea camera like this:\\n&gt;The *Central America* looks truly like a storybook treasure.\\n\\nIf \"storybook treasure in a kid\\'s book\" doesn\\'t raise hackles I don\\'t know what would. Storybook stories a.k.a. \"songs\" are a constant touchstone in *ASOIAF*. *ASOAIF\\'s* constant theme that real life is not a story—\\n&gt;The fat leather-bound volume was full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. Children\\'s stories, if truth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history. *(ASOS Daenerys VI)*\\n\\n—is famously exemplified by none other than Littlefinger:\\n&gt;\"Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\" *(AGOT Sansa III)*\\n\\nIndeed, Littlefinger\\'s lesson seems drawn straight out of the reporting on the Ship of Gold as it stood when GRRM went to write *AGOT*: The vaunted \"storybook treasure\" Thompson had found via much ballyhooed technological brilliance and claimed in the 1989 *Post* article could be worth \"$1 billion\" was reported in universal coverage of a key court ruling c. November 1993 to be worth only $21 million — almost $10 million less than the $30 million the same court ruling said had been spent to recover it.\\n\\nThus the finding and recovery of the \"storybook treasure\" looked, in the years *AGOT* was being written, to be a boondoggle.\\n\\nI think GRRM almost \"confirms\" that the Ship of Gold affair (as it stood c. 1995) inspired him via Jon\\'s story in *AGOT*. Jon gets to the Wall and is told that life there isn\\'t like \"the stories your wet nurse told you\" (i.e. stories \"in a kid\\'s book\", in Thompson\\'s words):\\n&gt;\"Cold and hard and mean, that\\'s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse.\" *-Donal Noye (AGOT Jon III)*\\n\\nAnd then, before *AGOT* is through, he learns, of all things, that \"digging for buried treasure\" (a la Thompson\\'s search for sunken treasure) refers not to a child\\'s romantic notion of an adventure but rather to the sordid fact of fucking \"whores\" in a hole in the ground:\\n&gt;On the Wall, he\\'d heard men call the whores \"buried treasures.\" He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. *(AGOT Jon IX)*\\n***\\n&gt;\"You know where I\\'d be if it was me? I\\'d be in Mole\\'s Town, digging for buried treasure.\" Toad\\'s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon\\'s mare snorted. *(AGOT Jon IX)*\\n\\nOf course, the fact that \"whores\" and thus Hoares have just been conflated with buried treasure rather tends to support the idea that the Hoare sigil\\'s gold ship is indeed a reference to the sunken treasure of the Ship of Gold.\\n\\n##The Smell of Bullshit Begins\\nBacking up, on October 6 1989, the *WaPo* ran a follow-up piece on the return of Thompson\\'s salvage ship to port in Norfolk called \"TREASURE HUNTERS\\' GOLDEN MOMENT\", covering the massive press events Thompson\\'s PR people organized. It\\'s easy to read it and see how GRRM may have begun to view the supposed heroes of a children\\'s story come to life as possibly at least slightly full of shit. (A la Littlefinger.)\\n\\nThis gem comes near the beginning:\\n&gt;Citing scientific and technological byproducts of the group\\'s successful search for the U.S. Mail Ship Central America and its cargo from the California gold rush, Thompson told a cheering crowd of his financial backers that **\"we learned there are many kinds of treasure, and that\\'s the best discovery of all.\"**\\n\\nIt\\'s *possible* that Thompson\\'s unbelievebly cheesy, afterschool special-assed quote — was he *really* talking about \"scientific… byproducts\" or was he talking about \"the real treasure being the friends we made along the way\"? — *didn\\'t* inspire GRRM to write the following exchange in which Littlefinger basically mocks such schlocky notions of \"treaure\":\\n&gt;Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, **\"You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.\"**\\n\\n&gt;**\"Oh, now there\\'s a treasure,\" Littlefinger said**, exiting. *(AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n\\nBut I wouldn\\'t bet on it. If GRRM read this shit or watched TV coverage, he would\\'ve seen right through Thompson\\'s claims to altruism. *Obviously* the \"best discovery of all\" was the *literal fucking treasure*, not whatever high-minded crap they were trying to peddle to seem like they weren\\'t motivated by greed. (And *oh my god* was a skeptical outlook vindicted in the coming decades. But that\\'s another story.)\\n\\nMaybe Thompson\\'s line about other kinds of treasure didn\\'t inspire GRRM to have (ironborn, possible Hoare) Mance say this—\\n&gt;\"And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that **her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me.**\" *(ASOS Jon I)*\\n\\n—and, having thus equated a \"gift\" from a woman with \"treasure\", to have our boy Littlefinger talk about the another \"kind of treasure\" that he clearly *does* relish:\\n&gt;\"There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me . . . but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. But she gave me something finer, **a gift a woman can give but once.** How could I turn my back upon her daughter? *(ASOS Sansa V)*\\n\\nBut it could have. Especially in conjunction with e.g. the 1992 *Life* \"story\"/P.R.-release, which was literally called \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\".\\n\\n(Notice what Littlefinger is doing in that passage. He is almost certainly *bullshitting* the hell out of Sansa. He wants to *use* Sansa, and he wants to fuck her. He\\'s like Thompson, talking about how great the scientific advancements are and acting like the story isn\\'t that he maybe just made a billion dollars.)\\n\\nThe article closes with more saccharine schmaltz from one of Thompson\\'s junior partners… and Thompson doing something very, very familiar to *ASOIAF* readers:\\n&gt;**Thompson stroked his curly beard, grinned and mused in his laconic fashion: \"We hope to be rich.\"** Evans, however, said it wasn\\'t that simple. \"There are so many things of value produced by an expedition like this,\" the historian said. \"To me it\\'s become a kind of celebration of American ideals -- free enterprise, hard work and the exploration of a frontier. **\"And in that way,\" he said with a smile, \"we\\'re already rich.\"**\\n\\n***\\n##CONTINUED IN OLDEST REPLY',\n",

       "  'body': 'It is a weird way for them to measure it to be sure. I did read what they were trying to say and how they measure it. \"Factors affecting Latency: Scan Rate, Polling Rate, Response Time, Connection Type\" this part to be specific on the last site. It boggles me that they went to the length of effort on making and explaining that site but make no mention of the inherent variance of the keystroke. Surely they must have noticed that they can have a natural variance of 30-300ms on a keyboard? At that point any actual difference from the latency that there may or may not be between two products is completely lost in the noise.\\n\\nOn my G815 the press triggers instantly when the key starts to go down and I got quite a light touch and don\\'t really push it too aggressively resulting in huge delay according to that site (since it starts the timer when the press triggers but ends the timer when it bottoms out, eh why?). On one of the rubberdomes I tried I got consistently low times and I feel like it liked that one since it registers the start of the stroke later and almost at the same time as the end of the stroke. Subjectively I feel that that keyboard is my least responsive to type or to play on. I also tried a long press distance mechanical keyboard and got average results with it.\\n\\nTo sum it up G815 with short actuation mechanical the average was extremely high 180ms. Long actuation but low resistance mechanical K65 about 80ms (I feel like it liked this one since it doesn\\'t trigger the stroke immediately but rather lets me pick a bit of speed first, It\\'s not as snappy a keyboard as the G815 but oh well.) And the king of the hill was the K120 that I got as a travel / backup keyboard, that one is a blazing fast 30ms area (not bad for 10 euro keyboard hehe). The test really got the opposite result of the \"speed\" of the keyboards that I would rank them at. I can\\'t help but feel that it is comparing apples and oranges. A fun little exercise though :)',\n",

The performance of the 6700xt is between a 3060 ti and 3070 in performance, sometimes outperforming the 3070 is some games because of more vram and optimization.\\n\\n[Klik hier om de onderdelen te zien (megekko winkelmand).](https://www.megekko.nl/wl/2QYEJ3AZ)\\n\\nSo the price of the pc build is €1300, far under your budget.

There is a perfect prebuilt tho which I think you'll love and I am so digging those keycaps, it's the Akko Tokyo series.\\n[60% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-3061s-rgb)\\n[65% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-3068b-plus-mechanical-keyboard)\\n[75% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-3084b-plus-mechanical-keyboard?_pos=9&amp;_sid=1e02cbe8d&amp;_ss=r)\\n\\n\\n2) Deskmat: With a nice keyboard you need a nice deskmat. So of course from Akko the Tokyo deskmat would fit so well and looks so god dam good, but if you don't like it I'll be adding a site where I personally always get my deskmats.\\n[Tokyo Deskmat](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-mouse-pad?_pos=4&amp;_sid=1e02cbe8d&amp;_ss=r)\\n[Mykeyboard.eu in-stock deskmats](https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/category/accessories/desk-mat_71/?selected_facets=num_in_stock_exact%3A%5B1+TO+%2A%5D)\\n\\n\\n3) Mouse, I mean I'll just recommend pulsar. Fast and light mouses, great to use. They have a lot of versions, but first you have to know your mouse grip. [Check here what your mousegrip is.](https://voltcave.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mouse-grip-styles.jpg)\\n\\nBased on the grip choose between these mice:\\nPalm grip: Xlite V2\\nPalm grip with small hands or claw grip: Xlite v2 mini\\nFingertip grip or relaxed claw with small hands: X2 mini\\nRelaxed claw grip: X2\\n\\n\\n4) Monitor, I mean I chose [this](https://www.megekko.nl/product/2077/921387/Monitoren/Lenovo-G24-20-24-165Hz-IPS-gaming-monitor). It's cheap for what you get, 165hz and a nice IPS panel. Works great for the pc.\\n\\n5) Headphones. Pretty important. If you want good audio quality I would recommend getting studio headphones with a seperate microphone. You can have closed back and open back headphones, closed back gives a more noise control effect and has a deeper bass whereas open back has an overall more clear sound and leaks audio out of the headphones. I personally prefer open back, but yeah preference.\\n[Open back](https://www.amazon.nl/HIFIMAN-Magnetische-Hoofdtelefoon-Audiofielen-Gevoeligheid/dp/B08ZJM3N22/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?)\\n[Closed back](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07T5V699K/ref=asc_df_B07T5V699K1682735280000/)\\n\\nDo note that for the he400se, the sound will actually improve a lot if you use an [dac](https://www.wifimedia.eu/nl/ifi-audio-zen-air-dac.html?). \\n\\n7) Microphone, the [mpm1000u](https://www.amazon.nl/Marantz-Professional-MPM1000-Grootmembraan-Studio-Opname/dp/B01C05AL4C/ref=asc_df_B01C05AL4C/?) is great. Adding a boom arm is recommended, but up to you :)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, want different parts or anything else let me know! If you would like an ultrawide monitor for example or a 1440p monitor, we'll have to change that and change the build a bit to make it better for this higher resolution. The case airflow isn't great, but with these parts it'll be good enough.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Of course! [I own one](https://i.imgur.com/ilkRg3z.jpg), though it\\'s actually my second Nakaya. My point is it isn\\'t constructive to compare how much you *could* spend in two hobbies, because the answer for both is always essentially infinite.\\n\\nA more useful metric is how most people experience the hobby. That requires two points: what\\'s the cheapest you can \"get in to the hobby for\" (spend at least enough to get some idea of what the hobby is about and why people like it/might go deeper), and what\\'s the point at which you *can* spend more, but you won\\'t get any objectively better features.\\n\\nMost Nakayas are around $700~800. Of course there are the raden and maki-e models which scale well in to five figures... but those are art pieces. Can you really argue someone shopping for a TWSBI would get more for their money if they bought a $30,000 Nakaya? I could also commission a solid brass Austin or custom Keycult and then pay for it to be hand scrolled. That would probably be north of 10k but not enough people \"experience the hobby\" like that to make it worthwhile to discuss.\\n\\nFountain pens probably have a longer \"tail\" to be sure - they turn in to art pieces more than pens in the low thousands. Even Montblanc\\'s writer editions and great character editions fall in to this IMO, as do Pelikan\\'s limited edition Souveran pens.\\n\\nI can give someone a Platinum Preppy and an ink cartridge and they can get what the hobby is about for around $5. I can hand someone a Red Dragon mechanical and they can get what the hobby is about (at least a little bit), but the cheapest I see for those is around $35. I can see the case for something like a TWSBI Eco or Lamy Safari and a bottle of ink ($40~50) being \"the entry point\", but I\\'d actually argue that\\'s more where most people in the hobby reside and would be more akin to a Keychron Q1 or GMMK Pro build ($250 or so, once you account for switches &amp; caps). This is at a point where you\\'re deeper in to \"getting it\" so I don\\'t think a prebuilt makes sense from the keyboard side anymore.\\n\\nI would say you keep getting \"more from your money\" in the fountain pen space up until $200 or so. You can use a Pilot Custom as the example instead of the Lamy, it doesn\\'t really matter. Throw enough ink to last *years* in and some nice paper or a very nice bound book and you\\'re at maybe $300. Once you have a gold nib, solidly built pen from a well respected manufacturer, spending more stops buying you features. The equivalent in the keyboard space might be something like the QK75, plus keycaps from a real manufacturer instead of clones, and maybe some nicer switches like Oil Kings, Box Jades, or Boba U4Ts. Now that\\'s a $500 keyboard compared against a $200 pen.\\n\\nSo at the cheapest possible entry point we have about $5 vs. $35\\n\\nIn the low end we have $45 vs. $250\\n\\nAnd the point where our money stops objectively going way further we have $300 vs. $500\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I\\'d say that\\'s how most people \"experience\" the hobby, and why fountain pens are objectively noticeably cheaper.\\n\\nI\\'ve got Watermans, Pelikans, Montblancs, a Conid, a Nakaya, a handful of TWSBIs, a handful of Lamys, enough ink to last a lifetime. Ten years of buying pens and the average pen cost is probably around $300. Five years in keyboards, only one or two of which are arguably high end (Akko MOD 007, KBD67 Lite, NK87 alu, Metakey Tenet brass, Driftmechanics Forever65, Driftmechanics Austin, plus all the switches and caps I\\'ve bought), my average is pushing $700 per build.',\n",

       "  'body': ' Hello everyone, recently I decided to buy a Keychron Q6 (yes, size does matter to some). I\\'ve been using more or less everything in the past, from classic IBM keyboards with a DIN plug to fancy (and easily borked) Logitech peripherals. Now after my most recent G915 borked out I decided to go back to the type of keyboard I tend to love most, a nice mechanical one, partially since I had fond memories of my now ancient DAS Ultimate and the IBM\\'s of ancient history. Now.. here\\'s the thing.. I\\'ve been reading way too much on these forums which results in a severe case of FOMOM, fear of missing out mods, so... I\\'m looking for advice. The Keychron I bought came with \"OSA\" caps, a profile I didn\\'t expect to love, but well.. shoot me, I like the form and feel. I don\\'t however like the colors and the spacebar kind of makes a racket, so.. any tips for me? I\\'m looking for a combo keycap set that\\'s olive green + grey, doesn\\'t come with a 2 year wait, bonus points if it allows for backlight to shine through (no I don\\'t need the backlight, but it\\'s nice to have) and more than that, something with a spacebar that tocks instead of pings, tips that include a combo of two sets are perfectly fine as well. the profile I prefer is similar in height to the custom OSA of Keychron but the shape isn\\'t that important I guess. (Yes, you\\'re also allowed to tell me to go hunt unicorns instead, I get it). Any tips on better switches are also welcome, currently using the default Gateron linears that came with it, I prefer clicky, but.. these days there\\'s a baby asleep in the room next to me, so linear it is :P',\n",

       "  'body': \"Full size keyboard are becoming more common in the custom enthusiast space. It all started because a lot of people didn't need everything on a full size 104 key keyboard and sought to simplify things. Companies like IBM made the Space Saver Keyboard (SSK) versions of the Model M, but there weren't many in the early 2000s. Bringing back the TKL was first and it's gotten smaller since. Many find the benefits of a smaller main keyboard with a separate numpad to be the sweet spot in terms of usability.\\n\\nAs for media keys, which seems to be a major point for you, almost every enthusiast keyboard uses a form of re-programmable firmware. Most of them are QMK based, with compatibility for VIA/VIAL graphic interfaces, others use TMK or others depending on features and components used. This re-programmable firmware allows easy remapping of keys to be whatever you want. Different function layers for alternative layouts, use of omitted physical keys like F keys and nav keys on a 60/65%. You can program play/pause/skip/etc. wherever you want. The benefit of this is that the keyboard map is stored on the physical board and not in the software on your computer. Macros are also very easy to accomplish using these firmwares.\\n\\nI would say in the last five years or so, the emphasis in the custom keyboard space has been on sound and aesthetics. This can be seen in the sheer number of themed keycap group buys. That's not personally my cup of tea, I far prefer tasteful color accents and neutral tones.\\n\\nPrebuilts from gaming companies and the major computer manufacturers sometimes add dedicated media keys to help differentiate their product and sell more. But Corsair charging $200 plus for their shitty mechanical keyboards is asinine. There is little value in it, and aesthetic customization is often limited because they use non-standard keycap sizes.\\n\\nIf you want an inexpensive full-size keyboard, I'd recommend Keychron's Pro series K boards. They use a plastic chassis but have QMK/VIA compatibility, hotswap sockets for changing switches to your liking, and standard keycap sizes. You could get the K10 Pro with switches and a cheap keycap set to match your preferences for less than a Corsair K100.\\n\\nIf you want a nicer machined aluminum case, the Keychron Q6 is there for you. If you don't need the navigation cluster as much (or don't mind accessing it on a different layer) the Q5 is a compact fullsize layout called the 1800 layout.\",\n",

[Colorful keyboards](https://igearworld.com/product/keybee/) are smaller and may not contain a number pad or other keys, whereas full-size keyboards feature all the keys, including a number pad. When choosing a size, take into account your particular preferences and work space.  \\n**Backlighting**: Think about a keyboard with LED backlighting if you want to use your keyboard in low light or just enjoy the way it looks. Even customized lighting effects are available on certain keyboards.  \\n**Connectivity**: Keyboards can be connected to your computer using Bluetooth, USB, or other wireless protocols. Think about your configuration and if a wired or wireless connection is best for you.  \\n**Price**: Keyboards can cost anything from $20 and several hundred dollars. Choosing a keyboard should take your budget into account.  \\n**Here are some prominent keyboard alternatives to keep in mind**:  \\n**Logitech K810**: This wireless keyboard is a fantastic choice for typing in dim light because it is small and illuminated.  \\n**iGear**: This mechanical wireless keyboard has adjustable illumination and a sturdy design.

You often read words like *genre-defying,* and frankly, a lot of the time they don’t land as they are meant to. However, in the case of the entire career of **Fear Factory** and certainty of the album *Demanufacture* (**Roadrunner Records**), the words can never do proper justice to the music. Simply stated, *Deamnfacture* is one of the most important, unique, and unapologetically brutal albums in heavy metal history.\\n\\nFear Factory was already ahead of its time with its legendary demo, produced by **Ross Robinson**, their debut *Soul of A New Machine*, and their inventive remix album *Fear is the Mindkiller* (both Roadrunner). So clearly they were building up to something grandiose for their pivotal third release. How much of game-changer this album would have been tough to predict at the time, but after its release would go on to be impossible to deny.\\n\\nWe could write this entire retrospective about the title track ‘Demanufacture’ alone. Everything about the song was next level big. The one of a kind right-hand chugs, the uncanny riffs, powerful and technical drumming, and **Burton C. Bell’s** unique vocals, fully come into his own just in the first few minutes of the song. It is as good an opening track on any album in the entire decade of the 1990s. The track clearly set the template that not only was this a vastly improved effort for the band, you were hearing something truly brand new and life-affirming. A sound that could change your very DNA, and would impact how metal was created and recorded afterward.\\n\\nThe album continues going from strength to strength, as complex riffs, inventive melodies, and brutal parts just smash your earpiece. And the hooks! Even the heaviest songs on *Demanufacture* have amazing hooks and memorable, sing-a-long parts. You can’t really even say that about the majority of extreme metal, which is why the band’s popularity exploded.\\n\\nSongs like Self ‘Bias Resistor’ and ‘Zero Signal’ we just thick with drama and intensity. The terrific extra-musical parts from sequencers, and keyboards, movie sound effects, and other ear candy owed as much to the suffocating Orwellian dystopia of movies like *Blade Runne*r (a prior influence) and [***The Terminator***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpMg1upld0w) franchise, in which the band clearly interpolated both musically and aesthetically. Frequent collaborator Rhys Fulber (F**ront Line Assembly**) and **Reynor Diego** added a lot of the synths and practical samples, along with Bell. The man versus machine battle played out over eleven tracks is brilliant and foreshadowed our current society in a prescient way. In [**Ghost Cult’s 2016 interview**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/interview-dino-cazares-of-fear-factory-the-future-is-here/) with **Dino Cazares**, he laid out his vision for what they were going for conceptually: \\n\\n“***On this record, what we wanted to talk about was not the man versus the machine but the man and the machine becoming one. The singularity process would actually be where man and machine have become one. In other words, they are able to create a cell – a little mechanical cell that they could inject into your body…like certain diseases that you have in your body, like cancer cells or obviously nano-technology. So once they perfect that…what’s next? Man and machine becoming one, and that’s what we’re talking*** ***about on this one.”***\\n\\n“***Actually even when you’ve got people like Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Hawking talking about the singularity process, they’ll also try to stop it, which is kind of ironic.”***\\n\\n***“Remember the whole cloning wars when everybody was cloning sheep and dogs? They put a law that you couldn’t do that. Obviously you’re going to be able to clone a human. You pretty much can already, but there’s a law against it. That’s pretty much what they think that is going to happen in the near future where they’re going to put a law against technology and humans becoming one.”*** \\n\\nArguably the bands’ best known and best overall track ‘Replica,’ was a minor hit on metal radio, the video was in rotation at **MTV’s Headbangers Ball,** and the song became a trademark for the band. Bell was never more heartfelt, impactful, or dynamic in his delivery and the track is just bliss to all headbangers. Bell’s vocal style and his deft ability to swap back and forth between melody and guttural vocals grew a wave of imitators, that ven found its way into mainstream metalcore and rock decades later.\\n\\nNormally most bands have a top-heavy album that falls off in the middle, but not **FF.** ‘New Breed’ is almost a thrash death metal mash-up with a hypnotic beat that just sucks you in. Next up, their cover of **Head of David’s** ‘Dog Day Sunrise’ is a fan favorite, and owes a lot to their kinship with all of **Godflesh** and (HoD)’s **Justin Broadrick** musically and as genre leaders.\\n\\n‘Body Hammer’ almost has a New York Hardcore riff to it, and maybe it’s just me, but the machine sounds during the song my have influenced the MCU’s *Iron Man* movie when Tony Stark makes the first suit in a cave and [**hammers the metal parts into shape**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHU49CD0TOs). Another great song. ‘Flashpoint’ is short and has a very 1980s proto-industrial metal *Musiq-concrete* style that I like. ‘Pisschrist’ is another deep cut that could have been the best song on any other album and a personal favorite of mine to this day.\\n\\nWith the epic closing track ‘A Therapy For Pain’ the band displayed their full vision, changing what was possible for many bands making heavy music. The set the standard and would be not only an influence on progressive metal and death metal bands in that decade such as **Meshuggah** and **Mnemic**, but they would also shape several subgenres such as melodic death metal (**At The Gates**, early **Soilwork**), **Static-X** and more commercial industrial bands) as well. They birthed a vision uncluttered and sleek, ready to be spoon-fed into our frontal lobes. Not even the biggest bands of the decade like **Metallica, Pantera, Slipknot,** and **Type O Negative**, all with multiple major releases in the genre could overshadow the greatness of this album. It was definitely a combined team effort from the band, and without a doubt in the pantheon of greatest albums ever. And that is no exaggeration at all. \\n\\n**Discussion Ideas:**\\n\\n* Praise?\\n* Criticisms?\\n* Personal experiences\\n* Best/Worst tracks?\\n* Has the album impacted the Metal scene?\\n* How has the artist evolved and was/is it a good direction?',\n",

This is the first modern mechanical keyboard I have purchased. Typing on it takes some getting used to.  The last time I typed on a keyboard like this was in the 1980's using a DEC Vax or IBM System 360.  It feels really different to typing on any other keyboard that  own. \\n\\nOverall I am impressed with the build and the noise is reassuringly clicky.  But I think I am getting more wrist strain with it.  My fingers and wrists feel more tired than typing on my scissor switch keyboards and I can feel pain in my elbows as typing gives me tennis elbow. The keys have to travel too far.   I wonder if there are better switches for me as it is hot swappable?\\n\\nI have ordered to the palm rest because the base is so thick to see if that helps.    \\n\\n\\nIf I keep it, the keycaps need to get changed.  The F and J do not have a significantly raised enough tactile dash to touch type and some of the keys are hard to read as I am partially sighted. \\n\\nI am not 100% sure I will keep it or whether it will end up on eBay.

These switches provide a tactile and audible feedback when pressed, which many users find more satisfying and comfortable than the softer, quieter feel of traditional keyboards. Mechanical keyboards are also known for their durability and long lifespan, as the switches are typically rated for tens of millions of keystrokes.   \\n\\n#',\n",

If you press your key all the way down, then you\\'ll need to let it back up at least past the halfway point before you\\'ll be able to register a new keypress.\\n\\nWooting keyboards (and others that advertise \"Rapid Trigger\" or Hall Effect switches) use a newer type of switch that are different from standard mechanical switches. They allow you to not only set the exact actuation point you want (can be 0.1mm if you want), but they also do not require you to release it back up past the actuation point to register a new press, as soon as you begin to release the press, then you can immediately press down again and it will count it as a new keypress.\\n\\nThis can help massively in stamina and stream heavy maps.',\n",

       "  'body': \"The detection mechanism is the limitation for membrane keyboards, IIRC. For mechanical keyboards you'd be hard-pressed to find one that didn't have theoretical NKRO support (no ghosting in the hardware level). The only other piece of the puzzle is that you have to use the extended USB keyboard spec to report key state with larger data packets, rather than the legacy keyboard spec. NKRO isn't supported by the host in BIOS (dunno about UEFI) so a keyboard with NKRO enabled might not function in the BIOS screens. But every modern operating system has native support for the extended reporting. Most commercial gamer keyboards have a toggle switch for NKRO so it'll still work in BIOS if you turn NKRO off. Same in QMK, et al. They have functions to toggle it and you can set it up to be on by default.\\n\\nThe main reason most don't have it enabled by default/all the time is the BIOS thing coupled with the fact that 6KRO is almost always enough.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"1. Dust filters. The less dust gets in your case, the better. Vacuuming the floor around the PC helps. May want to clean the dust off from time to time anyway, as some very small quantities will still get it and accumulate over time.\\n2. Keep liquids off, especially with cases with top mesh or fan opening, but projectile fluids can get in from any direction anyway depending on where you are when you spill them, so just keep the PC somewhere it can't be reached if you spill a coffee. Same goes for mechanical keyboards.\\n3. Keeps pets and children off. Risks are minimal when supervised, but don't underestimate the combined effect of creativity, curiosity and many hours of unsupervised time near the PC. (Kind of like managing room/floor fans with pets and children. The risk is usually low, but you don't want prolonged unsupervised exposure.)\\n4. No CPU installation or any other fragile work when you're tired, sleep, distracted, angry, hurried, jittery, high on caffeine, or after a beer or two. Watch the pins, watch the paste. No hurried jobs. Keep the emotions in check if you need to take the CPU out and put it back in — no more than 2 or 3 unsuccessful attempts in a row is my rule. Treat emotions like responsible drivers treat alcohol. They work kinda the same.\\n5. PSU: You don't have to buy 1200W Titanium, but I wouldn't go below Gold and like 200W surplus. Prefer PSUs that allow you to switch the fan off completely, even manually, to avoid wasting its working hours because PSU fans are a pain to replace. Listen to any new PSU through a vacuum-cleaner pipe or toilet-paper roll to make sure you don't hear coil whine and/or some other nasty sounds. (Do the same acoustic test for GPUs always, and you may want to do it also for soundcards and certain parts of motherboards if you're highly sensitive to sound. But PSU and GPU is kinda mandatory if you're a normal person with the PC case sitting close to where you sit, even several metres/yards).\\n6. This one isn't really about PC health/maintenance, but it comes close and is related: Check manuals and specs and take precise measurements to make sure everything is compatible and there's space for everything. This is less of a problem these days that the stores accept returns more readily but anyway. Don't assume anything, don't rely on calculations based on manual specs if they outcome suggests something like 2mm clearance. Don't brute-force anything unless you really know what you're doing and can manage the financial risk involved.\\n7. The bottom-line takeaway is mostly to avoid doing stupid things or taking stupid risks. Everybody knows this rule, obviously, and mostly follows it, but the difficult task is to control oneself and avoid making exceptions when you're in a hurry or get emotional. **Sticking with the 'don't do stupid' rule 100% of the time as opposed to 99% is the challenge.**\",\n",

       "  'body': 'I have the mechanical one. I\\'ve owned a few mechanical keyboards and bought this because my work mouse is an mx master 3.\\n\\nI regret buying it because I just have seen other keyboards do everything better and from a big company like Logitech I expect more.\\n\\n1. Backlight\\n\\n1a. Unless it\\'s plugged in you can\\'t always have the backlight on. If you\\'re plugging it in why buy a wireless keyboard?\\n1b. The timeout of the lights for the keyboards is 30 seconds and this is not changeable. Now I\\'m a developer so sometimes I\\'m just looking at my code and not typing and when I get ready to type if I had my hand on the keyboard I have to press something for the lights to come on. If my hand wasn\\'t on it fine I just need to hover my hand to turn on the lights but that still takes a second.\\n1c. It wouldn\\'t bother me that much if not for a and b but you only get white lights. Sure I typically only use wight or blue static lights but you are spending 100+ on the keyboard the lights don\\'t stay on and it\\'s only white lights that honestly aren\\'t that bright.\\n\\n2.compatibility with other logitech products \\n2a. The receiver is a logibolt which believe it or not does not work with the majority of productivity mice of logitech. Not the mx master or the triathlon I have. Which is fine if you want to use Bluetooth but at work Bluetooth messes up frequently so that means I need 2 recievers as the keyboard is also not compatible with the unifying receiver. Both the unifying receiver and logibolt receiver are things logitech brags about they don\\'t seem to have put to much effort into them.\\n2b. Flow. All the items I\\'ve mentioned are \"compatible\" with logitech flow. The mice \"work\" but do not switch over the keyboard with them most times. It\\'s maddening because I bought a k380 to test flow before this and that works most time but not this keyboard.\\n2c. Easy switch does not switch the mouse. It\\'s another one of those things that you would think would work and when it doesn\\'t you wonder why u stuck with one brand. I\\'m not gonna mention another brand in this comment but I will say there is another low profile mechanical keyboard with multi device that happens to have some orange keycaps exists I\\'ve tested it and I honestly I should have stuck to.\\n\\n3. It\\'s not the best feeling blue switches\\nI can\\'t speak to the other colors (red or brown) because I don\\'t own them but of the 4 mechanical keyboards I own/owned this only really feels better than the $50 one\\n\\n\\nTldr. The keyboard does everything it says it does and does none of those things well and at its price you really ot to just buy something else or if muti device isn\\'t why you are buying it get a kit and have some fun making your own mechanical keyboard',\n",

Let\\'s +1 each other!\\n\\n## About me AKA \"Who is this man?\"\\n***Physically -*** I\\'m 22, single, fair, dark brown hair/eyes, active/athletic (5\\'11/75kg), non-smoker, social drinker, clean/DDF. Happy to verify each other with photos early on.\\n\\n***Personality -*** Think Ben Wyatt x Thomas Shelby. I\\'m a mixture of passion, support, and just the right amount of deviancy. I\\'ve been described as playful, sadistic, caring, communicative, honest, creative, mature, witty, curious, easy to talk to, driven, patient, open-minded... and a lot more. My love languages tend to be quality time, physical touch, and words of affirmation.\\n\\n***Interests -*** Part homebody, part social. I\\'ve got a pretty eclectic assortment of interests, including: TV/film (almost any genre), music (I play the guitar and pen poems), art (Museum dates?? Yes!), games (tabletop + video + trivia), reading/writing (tied to my hobby), health (mental + physical), cooking (it\\'s in my blood), civic activism/progressive social issues (I\\'m on the left), keyboards (mechanical + musical), languages (I speak three and continuing to learn a fourth), value investing (Graham more than wallstreetbets), and machine learning (not the Skynet kind!). Hopefully we share a few interests already.\\n\\n***Daily life -*** I\\'m goal-oriented. I have a career that I\\'m passionate about, and love to juggle multiple projects (both professionally and hobbies). I am trying to be financially independent and almost there. Plus lots of miles for travel! I consider D/s to be an essential part of my romantic relationship, not just something for the bedroom (more on that below). I will always make time for my partner and expect the same in return. Communication is a huge part of any healthy relationship.\\n\\n## Who and what I\\'m looking for\\nLet\\'s be a kinky power couple together! Submission and D/s are not mutually exclusive from having agency in life. In fact, they\\'re complimentary. I\\'m looking for someone who considers herself passionate/driven/ambitious (whatever that means to you) - but also dreams of relinquishing control in the right hands. Someone craving to be with a trusted partner who will challenge her, and help her succeed in everything she desires in life through the care, safety, structure, pleasure, discipline of a holistic D/s dynamic...

       "  'body': 'After a lifetime of my younger brother receiving my hand-me-down PCs as I upgraded, and after years of him not even owning his own PC or even Mac laptop, I decided that PC gaming would be a fun way to reconnect long-distance with him. My original plan was to build myself an upgraded system and give him my current one, but to be honest my current system is more than enough for my needs and meaningfully upgrading would\\'ve been very expensive. Instead, I decided to build him his own with (mostly) all-new hardware. But just to exercise my older brother privilege, I did swap out my PC\\'s PSU for a 750W model and gave him my old 600W one. I\\'m also giving him a spare Dell G-SYNC 144Hz 27\" 1440p monitor that\\'s not very good (TN panel, bad viewing angles), but will be replacing it with my Acer Predator 27\" 144Hz GSYNC monitor once my Dough Spectrum OLED arrives to replace it.\\n\\nTo make up for the hand-me-downs, I supplied a custom-built, hand-lubed mechanical keyboard, a new Logitech mouse, and an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller.\\n\\n**Parts Summary:**\\n\\n* Velkase Velka 7 (6.9L) v2.1 case w/ PCIe 4.0 riser cable\\n* Gigabyte B550I AORUS Pro AX ITX motherboard (Rev 1.2)\\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600 CPU (PBO undervolted, -20 offset all cores, +200MHz)\\n* 32GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3600 CL16 RAM\\n* Alpenföhn Black Ridge CPU cooler, w/ swapped Noctua NF-A9x14 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) fan\\n* MSI Ventus 2x RTX 4070 OC, deshrouded + 2x Noctua NF-A12x15 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) fans\\n* 2TB Western Digital SN770 SSD\\n* Corsair SF600 80Plus Platinum PSU\\n* Keychron Q2 Pro keyboard in e-white, w/ Keychron K Pro Silent Brown switches (hand-lubed by me), orange &amp; white PBT dye-sub keycaps\\n* Kraken keyboards aviator-style orange  coiled USB-C cable\\n* Logitch G PRO X Superlight mouse\\n* Microsoft Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller + the Elite Series 2 accessory kit (carrying case, paddles, replacement D-pad, charger, etc.)\\n\\n**The Build:**\\n\\nI previously built my gaming PC in an NCase M1 v6.1 with very similar parts (earlier revision of the same motherboard, a 5600X, same RAM, and a leftover 1080 that I later replaced with a 3080 12GB after GPU prices came down last year), which was the first time I\\'d built anything in the ITX/SFF arena. I guess I got bit by the bug, because I can\\'t imagine building in a full-size case again, at least for this sort of machine. Building SFF is just too much fun!\\n\\nI decided for this machine I wanted to go even smaller than the NCase\\'s nearly 13L while still maintaining reasonable thermals, and without saddling my brother with significantly worse performance than my own PC. Although I feel NVIDIA\\'s RTX 4070 is not the best value at $600, the efficiency bump it represented over my own 3080 12GB while maintaining equivalent performance seemed like the perfect GPU to fit into an even smaller case. I was originally looking at the Velka 5, but it was out of stock pending a refresh, and the requirement of the Flex-ATX power supply struck me as non-ideal for noise. So I went for the Velka 7, which at a scant 5.9L was still by far the smallest case I\\'d ever built in, but I felt would offer a good balance between diminutive size and decent noise/thermals.\\n\\nI also decided to stick with Zen 3 because the Alpenföhn Black Ridge doesn\\'t support the new AM5 socket mounting mechanism, and because going with Zen 3 parts allowed me to save considerably on all the core parts; the CPU, motherboard, and RAM were all notably cheaper by sticking with the previous generation, and at 1440p I don\\'t think going bleeding edge is really necessary.\\n\\nThe build itself was very fun, albeit a bit challenging given the tight spaces involved. I had to remove both the motherboard\\'s backplate and the M.2 heatsink included with the board to avoid interference with the PCIe riser cable routing and the CPU cooler\\'s fan, respectively. And the process of actually getting the assembled \"compute brick\" (what I\\'ve taken to calling the sandwich-layout motherboard + GPU assembly) inside the case took a bit of finagling, with all the display extension cables needing to be pre-plugged and routed prior to installation. That said, I wouldn\\'t describe it as painful by any stretch, and the case is quite well made.\\n\\nThe last tricky bit was the GPU. Having had great luck with de-shrouding my 3080 12GB in the NCase and using two bottom-mounted Noctua NF-A12x25s to cool it effectively and quietly, I wanted to try a similar thing with this GPU. Despite having a maximum power draw of only 200W vs my 3080\\'s 350W, I suspected using 2x 120mm fans, albeit slim ones, would still allow for much quieter cooling than the 2-slot card\\'s native shroud and fans. I was so confident about this I didn\\'t even test the card\\'s own cooler, I just took it off before ever powering it on. I also initially zip-tied the fans to the side panel, which made installation a little tricky and wound up with little zip-ties sticking out of the side panel.\\n\\nInitially, I had both fans plugged into the GPU\\'s on-board header with a CRJ micro 4-pin PWM dual fan splitter. However, I found that for whatever reason, the on-board fan controller wouldn\\'t spin the two fans any slower than 1300RPM. While not exactly *loud*, I wouldn\\'t describe that speed as \"quiet\" either. Annoyed, I slapped a couple LNA adapters between the splitter and the fans, which weirdly made zero difference. They spun up slower, but the card still insisted on running them at 1300RPM minimum. Annoyed, I pulled them out and put the stock cooler back on the card for testing. While it wasn\\'t annoyingly loud, it was still louder than I wanted.\\n\\nEncouraged by some online friends to try out FanControl, I again removed the stock GPU cooler and re-installed the fans, this time connecting them via a fan cable + splitter routed from the motherboard\\'s \"System 1\" header around to the GPU side of the case. Immediately I was able to spin them down as low as a scant 250RPM, which was completely inaudible. After more testing and tweaking, I found a great balance between effective cooling performance and acceptably quiet noise levels. I also found that I was able to simply pressure-fit the fans between the GPU and the side panel, and while I probably wouldn\\'t trust that for shipping in the mail, they seem perfectly stable for \"sitting on a desk\" duty.\\n\\nMy last tweaking test was to see if reversing the GPU fans from intake to exhaust would help pull a little extra hot air from the CPU side of the case via overall negative pressure. However, unfortunately because of the design of the Noctua fans and the GPU\\'s heatsink not going from fan corner to fan corner, the lower fan\\'s blades interfered with the heatsink and stopped spinning. So I\\'m stuck with intake, since the exhaust side has a built-in grille which protects the fan blades, and the intake side has all four rubber pads making contact with the side panel.\\n\\n**Thermal Performance:**\\n\\nAs a \\\\~6L case, the Velka 7 doesn\\'t have a whole lot of room to breathe, especially on the CPU side. CPU temps are correspondingly warm, typically stabilizing in the 72–75°C range during gaming loads. All-core CPU heavy activity can push the CPU up to 80°C at its 77W power limit, though as a gaming-focused system I doubt this will be much of a concern most of the time. Even this is well below TJMax.\\n\\nGPU temperatures are much nicer. The 4070\\'s low power draw is made even lower by a so-far rock solid stable 2640MHz @ 910mV undervolt, with Unigine\\'s Superposition benchmark sitting around 132W draw and 65°C, with the two Noctua fans whirring quietly at a sedate 1055RPM. Real-time ray tracing benchmarks can push the power draw up to 160W, with the fans getting slightly more audible in the 1100RPM range and temperatures sitting closer to 69°C (nice).',\n",

       "  'body': 'The best keyboard for you is the one you like most. A keyboard won’t improve your skill in game. Going from a membrane keyboard to mechanical may give you a slight improvement since the force required to press a key is lower on mechanical keyboards (usually). \\n\\nThe general consensus is that linear switches are best for gaming. Most keyboards come with the option of linear, tactile, and clicky. But the best switch is the one you like most. The switches are the primary thing that changes the way a keyboard feels, not the keyboard itself, so I’d recommend going to Best Buy or micro center or somewhere like that to test out some keyboards and decide what feels best to you. If you want the absolute lowest possible latency, look for optical switches. But just so you know the difference will be basically imperceivable from a regular switch.\\n\\nSome recommendations I would give are anything by Keychron, they’re inexpensive and consistently good quality. I’d also recommend getting one with hot swap sockets so you can change the switches out to try different types. \\n\\nIf you have some more money to spend, the Glorious GMMK Pro is a high quality, highly customizable board. \\n\\nAnd there’s a lot more that aren’t from traditional gaming brands.

       "  'selftext': 'As part of a writing floating the notion that Littlefinger has Hoare blood — (see [[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/12ofe7x/a_gold_ship_silver_chains_littlefinger_the_sigil/) — I discussed how each aspect of House Hoare\\'s sigil might hint that Littlefinger is a Hoare, noting that Littlefinger himself does something similar vis-a-vis Orton Merryweather and his sigil:\\n&gt;Petyr had once remarked that the horn of plenty that adorned House Merryweather\\'s arms suited Lord Orton admirably, since he had carrot-colored hair, a nose as bulbous as a beetroot, and pease porridge for wits. *(AFFC Cersei IV)*\\n\\nHere, I want to delve further into my suspicion that the \"gold longship on black\" portion of the Hoare sigil is (at least in some significant part) a reference to the [[*S.S. Central America* a.k.a. \"The Ship of Gold\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Central_America)].\\n\\nThe so-called Ship of Gold was a gold-laden ship that was sunk in 1857 in a storm 200 miles off the Carolina coast and lost 8000 feet down in the inky-black depths of the Atlantic Ocean until it was located in 1987 by an upstart team of young treasure hunters from Columbus, Ohio (of all places) led by a guy named Tommy Thompson. I suspect that Littlefinger\\'s character and in some ways his story may have been inspired in some significant part — although not entirely or even primarily — by the story of Thompson and the recovery of the sunken treasure from that ship as it was known c. 1995, when GRRM began writing *AGOT*. At bare minimum, I think GRRM recognized the resonances between the story of Thompson and the Ship of Gold and Littlefinger\\'s story by the time he designed the sigil of House Hoare (which was done c. May 1999, per my direct correspondance with Linda Antonsson).\\n\\nIf I\\'m right that Littlefinger has Hoare blood and Targaryen blood, his story is in some sense that of a man attempting to reclaim and recover what he may see as lost wealth and power (including that of the Hoares) that is rightfully his, right? There is a \"rhyme\" between this idea and that of recovering a long-lost treasure from the ocean floor. Especially because the story of the \"Ship of Gold\" as it stood c. 1995 involved a high-profile court battle for possession of the treasure between the clever young media-savvy treasure hunters who found, recovered and claimed the lost gold by right of abandonment and discovery — and who did everything they could to win the public\\'s support as adventuring heroes on a quest for a storybook treasure — and the legal \"heirs\" of the parties who held the rights to the gold after the ship was sunk in 1857 and sought to, from their perspective, *re*-claim via argument what they said was rightly theirs.\\n\\nThe finding of the Ship of Gold was big news when it was first announced in 1987, and bigger news when substantial gold was recovered in 1989. Database searches show headlines in hundreds of papers, and I have vague memories of television news coverage which I at present have no way to confirm. (I did find a Tonight Show appearance by one of the members of Thomspon\\'s crew [[on youtube](https://youtu.be/Det4qrOXvxE)].)\\n\\nThe \"Ship of Gold\" continued to make news in the early 90s as bunch of insurance companies — the legal \"heirs\" of the original insurers of the 1857 ship and its cargo of gold — sued the treasure finders, claiming the recovered treasure was actually theirs by rights. See e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/07/18/treasure-hunters-claim-450-million-shpwreck/5b2d53be-f770-4561-b514-5247b2e50777/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/14/storybook-treasure-found-off-south-carolina/e59459ac-31d6-4546-a482-18aaad62dafe/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/10/06/treasure-hunters-golden-moment/98812bc7-abc9-4b9f-abec-e51f5a97b811/, https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2014/10/21/treasure-hunt-on-high-seas/9315335007/, https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/us/a-treasure-from-the-seas-but-whose.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/08/15/the-law-of-finders-keepers/716ca9f2-6c80-4410-bb06-4a66000a4582/, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/28/us/insurers-to-share-shipwreck-s-gold.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/03/23/sunken-treasure-bounty-to-be-shared-with-heirs/a1ae96c9-d9c9-4e46-843e-bafda4071c88/, and especially this 1993 story, which alludes to and quotes some of the massive contemporaneous press coverage: https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19930627-1993-06-27-9306270057-story.html. A big story on the find in the March 1992 issue of then-ubiquitous *Life* magazine isn\\'t available online, but I got it from the library.\\n\\nThis writing will attempt to tease out various indications that Littlefinger\\'s story has something to do with this famous story of shipwreck and lost treasure. I figure I\\'ll start with two bits of low-hanging fruit.\\n\\n##Ships Sinking In Storms\\nHere\\'s the first line of a big March 1992 *Life* magazine feature on The Ship of Gold titled \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\". It opens with the tale of the Ship of Gold sinking in a storm in the fall of 1857:\\n&gt;A week out of Panama, on her 44th trip to New York, the *Central America* rounded the Flordia Keys and **ran smack in to a horrendous hurricane.**\\n\\nIsn\\'t curious, then, that there\\'s a \"throwaway\" line in *ASOS Tyrion VI* in which Tyrion wishes that Littlefinger\\'s ship would \"r[u]n into a storm at sea and s[i]nk\"?\\n&gt;He wondered if Petyr Baelish had reached the Vale yet. If the gods are good, he **ran into a storm at sea and sank.** But when had the gods ever been especially good?\\n\\nEspecially when Littlefinger\\'s *Merling King* is (as I argued in my main post discussing the Hoare sigil) a kind of \"Ship of Gold\", in that it transports \"Arbor Gold\" to the Vale.\\n\\n##Ship Insurance &amp; Wreckers\\nIf any one thing makes me truly *believe* that GRRM has written *ASOIAF* with the Ship of Gold saga in mind, it\\'s that *ADWD* \"just so happens\" to foreground two seemingly obscure notions, both of which are absolutely central elements of the \"Ship of Gold\" saga: (1) ship\\'s insurance and (2) \"wreckers\" who recover the wealth of shipwrecks.\\n\\nThe headline-making lawsuits about the Ship of Gold were all about a bunch of insurance companies — the heirs of the companies that sold ship\\'s insurance related to the *S.S. Central America* — suing the plucky storybook-come-true treasure finders. The insurance companies were pretty thoroughly villainized in the media.\\n\\nIn *ADWD The Ugly Little Girl,* Arya kills a man who insures ship\\'s cargos but doesn\\'t pay off when a shipwreck happens, and in *ADWD Tyrion VII* it\\'s mentioned that \"Vogarro\\'s whore\" (sounds like Hoare!) — a fabulously wealthy woman of low-birth whose business operations seem as variegated as those of the poor-boy-made-good Littlefinger — \"insured shipowners\". What a strange thing to repeatedly bring up in a fantasy novel… *unless* you\\'re riffing on a real-life story that involved ship\\'s insurance.\\n\\nAlso in *ADWD* — in *Davos I* — Davos visits the \"robber lord and wrecker\" Lord Borrell in Sisteron on Sweetsister. The entire story of the Ship of Gold was triggered, of course, by a wrecker (in the more benign sense of \"a person or vessel employed in recovering salvage from wrecked or disabled vessels\"), Thompson, finding the wreck of all wrecks. To the insurance companies, of course, he was a \"robber\", but to most of the public, the insurance companies challenging Thompson\\'s claim in court were, in effect, \"robber lords\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth nothing that GRRM paints both the wreckers—\\n&gt;The beacons that burned along the shores of the Three Sisters were supposed to warn of shoals and reefs and rocks and lead the way to safety, but on stormy nights and foggy ones, some Sistermen would use false lights to draw unwary captains to their doom. *(ADWD Davos I)*\\n\\n—and insurers—\\n&gt;\"He is writing each a binder. If their ships are lost in a storm or taken by pirates, he promises to pay them for the value of the vessel and all its contents.\" … \"No doubt many a captain sinking in a storm has taken some small solace in his binder back in Braavos, knowing that his widow and children will not want.\" A sad smile touched his lips. \"It is one thing to write such a binder, though, and another to make good on it.\" *(ADWD The Ugly Little Girl)*\\n\\n—as shady operators. Like Littlefinger, then.\\n\\n##Pirates! Littlefingerian Pirates!\\n&gt;Two hundred miles off the Carolina coast, on the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream (they will tell you this much, but no more, for even in the 1990s they worry about pirates)… *(Life Magazine \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\")*\\n\\nThe colorful media coverage often mentioned potential piracy — recall that \"the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves\" *(ASOS Samwell V)* — both literal (in terms of competing salvage teams trying to loot the wreck after it was located) and more figurative, i.e. of a type that \"rhymes\" with the type of pen-and-ink-and-bullshit \"war\" Littlefinger likes to conduct:\\n&gt;Now that they\\'d rescued the treasure, the explorers were taking no chances — potential pirates lurked at every turn.\\n\\n&gt;By now, however, they felt that \"pirates\" of another sort — not with swords and eye patches, but with ties and legal briefs — posed the real threat. *(Newport News Daily Press June 26, 1993 \"Tarnished Treasure\", linked above)*\\n\\nWhen courts found in favor of the insurance companies, it was not a popular decision, and these legal \"heirs\" were denounced as \"pirates\":\\n&gt;Editorial writers across the country denounced the decision.\\n\\n&gt;\"Ah, the ancient call of the open sea, in the days when men were men and Blackbeard sailed the bounding main!\" the Oakland Tribune wrote. \"Alas, there are landlubbing pirates afoot these days who would make Captain Hook look limp-hooked. They are called lawyers and insurers.\"\\n\\n&gt;Another editorial writer saw the insurance lawyers as \"pirates in pinstripes.\" *(ibid.)*\\n\\nOf course, from the perspective of the insurance companies and ultimately the courts (at least to a degree — see below), the real and far more literal pirate was Tommy Thompson. His group found the treasure, and he fought tooth and nail in court to keep it with no claim to title other than \"finders keepers\". From the perspective of the wealthy, powerful insurance establishment (and ultimately the legal establishment — at least technically), Thompsons\\'s refusal to return *any* of the treasure to its legal \"heirs\" was itself something of an act of ironborn-ish piracy itself. (Think here about Littlefinger wrangling with the old money Vale establishment.)\\n\\n(Interestingly, one of the insurance companies\\' public-facing lawyers arguing in 1991 that her clients had never abandoned the treasure nor their claims to it — Thompson\\'s side was arguing they *had* de facto abandoned it, making it up for grabs — was named… Mary**lyn** **Little**. [See: Lyn Corbray &amp; Littlefinger.] Is it possible GRRM read or saw her quoted on some TV news report about the affair, and thus that her name had some inspirational role? Doubtful, but tantalizing.)\\n\\nI think GRRM wrote Littlefinger (in part) with *both* parties to the conflict over the Ship of Gold in mind. The insurance companies were fighting for the rights of \"heirs\" using lawyerly \"piracy\" (piracy being synonomous with the ironborn), and Hoare-y Littlefinger sees himself as heir to multiple legacies and fights to regain them using similar pen-and-ink-and-bullshit. At the same time, Thompson was selling himself as the romantic figure Littlefinger longed to be as a child (when he played at being the Prince of Dragonflies) and more than a bit of a pirate himself (and that\\'s before more recent developments), and Littlefinger was written with him in mind, too.\\n\\nWhile Hoare-y Littlefinger adopts something like the legalistic tactics of the \"pirates in pinstripes\" denounced by the media, his story \"rhymes\" in a slew of way with that of the treasure-finder, Tommy Thompson, as it was told in the media at the time.\\n\\n##Abandoned Treasure, Abandoned Castle\\nThompson based his entire claim to the treasure on the fact that the insurance companies had demonstrably \"abandoned\" their claims to it. How does Littlefinger come to be Lord of Harrenhal, ancestral seat of House Hoare? Lady Whent abandoned it. (In multiple senses, actually.)\\n&gt;**Lady Whent** had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully, but she\\'d used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers, and **let the rest go to ruin. Now she was fled**… *(ACOK Arya VII)*\\n\\n\\n##Finders Keepers &amp; Squatter\\'s Rights\\nReporting on the court battle over Thompson\\'s find universally made reference to the principle of \"finders keepers\" following the initial lower court ruling in Thompson\\'s favor. \"Finders keepers\" seems in a way analogous to Littlefinger\\'s strategy vis-a-vis the Eyrie. He\\'s essentially trying to take it using something that\\'s not far removed from squatter\\'s rights: having gotten his toe in the door at the previous owner\\'s invitation, he subsequently refuses to leave. It\\'s very close to \"I found it, it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\n\\n##Not Without A Fight\\nWhere Thompson refused to give up the treasure he\\'d found to the insurance companies without a fight—\\n&gt;Thompson… wasn\\'t about to fling his hard-earned gold to the whims of the sea. He was going to fight. *(\"Tarnished Treasure\")*\\n\\n—Littlefinger found his \"treasure\", Cat—\\n&gt;There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me . . . but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. But she gave me something finer, a gift a woman can give but once. *(ASOS Sansa V)*\\n\\n—and refused to give her up to the scion of a much more powerful House without a fight. Nor, like Thompson in court, did he give up when hard-pressed by a seemingly superior, wealthy and powerful foe:\\n&gt;\"Yield!\" [Brandon] called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly. *(AGOT Catelyn VII)*\\n\\n##Battle Scars\\nLittlefinger was scarred in his fight with Brandon:\\n&gt;\"I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr\\'s life. He let him off with a scar.\" *-Catelyn (AGOT Catelyn IV)*\\n\\nThe lengthy, pirate-heavy, 1993 newspaper account of the story I\\'ve been quoting said this of Thompson:\\n&gt;As yet another court date approaches, Thompson admits to battle scars.\\n\\n(Given the way Thompson\\'s PR machine worked, it\\'s likely this was a narrative actively sold by Thompson, and thus something that may have been repeated in TV news and magazine show accounts and in other news and print magazine stories not easily accessible.)\\n\\n##Losing the Battle, Winning the War\\nLittlefinger lost his duel to Brandon, but (I believe) ultimately \"won the war\" by baiting Brandon into riding to his death in King\\'s Landing and by subsequently leveraging Lysa\\'s love into his current situation.\\n\\nThompson\\'s 1992 and 1993 legal \"losses\" to the insurance companies claiming the gold he found was theirs was analogous: While the Court of Appeals technically overruled a lower court and sided with the insurance companies, it also stipulated that Thompson\\'s group should still \"receive by far the largest share of the treasure\" and sent the case back for a lower court to determine the amount. In November 1993 an Admiralty court ruled that Thompson would get at least 90%. The ruling was upheld by the US Court of Appeals in June 1995 (long before GRRM finished writing *AGOT* in mid-1996) — one headline read \"Finders, (Mostly) Keepers\" — and the Supreme Court turned down a further appeal that October, definitively rendering the insurance companies\\' initial court victory pyrrhic and seemingly making Thompson, like Littlefinger, the ultimate winner.\\n\\n##Nerds vs. Cowboys, A Letter Writer vs. Knights\\nFrom early on the narrative sold to the world by Thompson using Ken Ringle of *The Washington Post* and the *Post\\'s* wire service—\\n&gt;Onto the scene… sailed… a low-profile shipload of computer-happy technocrats from Columbus, Ohio. In the ocean cowboy world of treasure hunters, their success story reads like the script for \"Revenge of the Nerds.\"\\n*([Washington Post - 9.14.1989 - \\'STORYBOOK TREASURE\\' FOUND OFF SOUTH CAROLINA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/14/storybook-treasure-found-off-south-carolina/e59459ac-31d6-4546-a482-18aaad62dafe/))*\\n\\n—is notably reminiscent of the story of Littlefinger transcending his provinical origins, his defeat by macho thug Brandon, and his exile to the Fingers at the hands of the knight and village-razer Hoster Tully to rise high using his wits in a world dominated by might and the sword.\\n\\n##Defiance, Ohio &amp; The Middle Finger\\nLittlefinger was of \"undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight\", \"a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets\" from a provincial backwater call \"The Fingers\". *(ACOK Tyrion IV; ASOS Sansa VI)* He\\'s from \"the the smallest of the Fingers\", which a look at the map suggests is in the same position as the middle finger (noting the \"thumb\" nub to the north) and which I suspect we\\'ll learn is *called* \"the Middle Finger\". Why? Because as we read in press accout after press account, Thompson, who couldn\\'t read until third grade, who flunked math and science tests in high school in high school, and who graduated from an unheralded midwestern state school where he was the only engineering student studying ocean engineering — i.e. who at least superficially had what we might call an \"undistinguished\" background before finding what was heralded as the greatest lost treasure ever — grew up in the tiny, rural backwater of *Defiance,* Ohio. Get it? Middle Finger. Defiance.\\n\\n(After first writing the foregoing paragraph a couple months ago, I realized that the \"Journeys\" map in the GRRM-approved *Lands of Ice &amp; Fire\" set confirms that the \"middle finger\" I suspected was Littlefinger\\'s *is* indeed where his tower is located.) \\n\\n(See also Littlefinger defying Brandon telling him to yield, defying the Vale lords, etc.)\\n\\n##Clever, Young, Creative Gold-Finders\\nEarly press accounts described Thompson in terms that are in many ways positively Littlefingerian: As a child, Thompson had been \"a precocious boy\". He built a working telephone when he was 8. *Life* began its profile of Thompson like this:\\n&gt;Tommy Thompson wasn\\'t like other boys growing up in Defiance, Ohio, in the 1960s. While his classmates were off slugging baseballs and imagining themselves to be Ted Williams [see: Brandon the \"jock\"], \"Tommy was always dragging home neighbors\\' junk from the alley — old TVs, radios, motors — and coming up with new inventions,\" remembers his sister Sandee Butterworth [shades of Butterwell, whose tourney in *The Mystery Knight* \"rhymes\" deeply with Littlefinger\\'s upcoming tourney at the Gates of the Moon]. But this wasn\\'t just another post-Sputnik nerd in the making.\\n\\nNow lauded by his investors as \"a great intellect\" and \"one of the smartest guys I ever met\", he was part of a group of \"young entrepreneurs\", and he and the team he put together showed \"creativity and entrepreneurship aplenty\" to \"far outrun\" older, competing salvage firms and find the lost Ship of God.\\n\\nAll that seems quite Littlefingerian:\\n&gt;\"I knew he would rise high,\" Catelyn said. \"He was always clever, even as a boy…\" *(AGOT Catelyn IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;[Lysa:] \"My father said he was too lowborn, but I knew how high he\\'d rise. Jon gave him the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when he increased the incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever he was and gave him other appointments, even brought him to King\\'s Landing to be master of coin.\" *(ASOS Sansa VI)*\\n***\\n&gt;[Littlefinger] moved his own men into place. … They were men of middling birth, by and large… but judging from their results, **far more able than their highborn predecessors.** *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n(Both Tullys speak of him \"rising high\". Obviously this foreshadows him taking over the Eyrie, per its height and the Arryns\\' words \"As High As Honor\", but \"rising high\" could also be seen as the inverse of *diving deep,* which Thompson had to do to find the wreck of the Ship of Gold on the deep sea floor, 8000 feet down.)\\n\\nBut the most obvious \"rhyme\" between Thompson and Littlefinger is that Thompson achieved fame because he found a bunch of gold. And Littlefinger? Same.\\n&gt;Littlefinger was… [a] clever… man, …always able to find[!] whatever gold the king or his Hand required… *(ACOK IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;\"The master of coin finds[!] the money.\" *-Littlefinger (AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;Littlefinger had been more use at court. He had a gift for finding[!] gold… *(AFFC Cersei IV)*\\n\\n\\n##Romantic Dreamers\\nThere was another angle to much of the coverage of Thompson, though. In addition to being a *clever* child, he was portrayed as a *dreamer*. The next sentence of above-quoted *Life* magazine profile pivoted from his childhood capacity for invention to his childhood imagination:\\n&gt;Though land-locked, Tommy and his buddy Barry Schatz often dreamed together about sea adventures, about the mysteries of what might be found on the floor of the ocean.\\n\\nA 1993 piece painted Thompson\\'s desire to *get fucking rich* as product of a boyhood \"love of the sea\" that included visions of \"scouring sunken ships\" for \"aging artifacts . . . perhaps even treasure\".\\n\\nThis compares to Littlefinger playing at the Prince of Dragonflies:\\n&gt;\"We\\'re all just songs in the end. If we are lucky.\" She had played at being Jenny that day, had even wound flowers in her hair. And Petyr had pretended to be her Prince of Dragonflies. Catelyn could not have been more than twelve, Petyr just a boy. *(ASOS Catelyn V)*\\n\\n\\n##Littlefinger &amp; Thompson Do P.R.\\nIn fact, Thompson waged a massively successful, \"carefully crafted high-profile media campaign\" to plant stories like this and garner coverage that painted him as a romantic hero fighting for the little guy. As *Forbes* put it much later:\\n&gt;Thompson always controlled the information flow. *([Forbes \"Ship of Fools\"](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0619/158.html?sh=40a6fd417dd9))*\\n\\nConsider in this regard Thompson\\'s quote in the wake of the US Court of Appeals decision finding for the insurance companies:\\n&gt;\"Only through our efforts has the lost legend of the S.S. Central America been rediscovered, the treasure-hunting group\\'s founder, Thomas G. Thompson, said in a statement. \"It saddens me to think it could be possible that a group of the largest insurance companies in the world could be awarded the treasure we worked so hard to find and recover.\" *(https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/28/us/insurers-to-share-shipwreck-s-gold.html)*\\n\\nLittlefinger is a little guy who plays at the romantic idea of being the Prince of Dragonflies and who jokes about cultivating a dastardly image while being a romantic using language reminiscent of Thompson\\'s, above:\\n&gt;Petyr Baelish smiled. \"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and **I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.**\" *(AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n\\nBut Littlefinger is acutely aware of the importance of public perception as Thompson was when he waged his successful PR campaign to paint his salvage mission as the fulfillment of romantic childhood dreams and fantasies about \"scouring sunken ships\" for \"aging artifacts . . . perhaps even treasure\". To wit, recall that he advises Cersei to launch what is in effect a P.R./media campaign regarding the rumors of her incest:\\n&gt;Petyr Baelish steepled his fingers. \"If we attempt to silence this talk, we only lend it credence. Better to treat it with contempt, like the pathetic lie it is. And meantime, fight fire with fire. … A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. … [If] we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold, well . . . the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon.\" *(ACOK Tyrion III)*\\n\\n##Littlefinger &amp; Thompson: Master Jugglers. (Also: Swan? *Again?*)\\nIn one anecdote, Thompson talks about how as a kid he built a lawn mower with four engines that pulled \"three rotary mowers\":\\n\"The problem was keeping all four engines running at once.\" [said Thompson] *(https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2014/10/21/treasure-hunt-on-high-seas/9315335007/)*\\n\\nKeeping a bunch of engines driving whirling blades all running at once? I can\\'t help but think of this:\\n&gt;A master juggler was Petyr Baelish. *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n—coupled with this:\\n&gt;A juggler kept a half-dozen swords and axes whirling through the air as skewers of blood sausage were brought sizzling to the tables, a juxtaposition that Tyrion thought passing clever, though not perhaps in the best of taste. *(ASOS Tyrion VIII)*\\n\\nEspecially because of the lines *immediately* preceding that last Tyrion quote:\\n&gt;\"Then came some strolling pipers and clever dogs and sword swallowers, with buttered pease, chopped nuts, and slivers of swan poached in a sauce of saffron and peaches. (**\"Not swan again,\"** Tyrion muttered, remembering his supper with his sister on the eve of battle.) *(ASOS Tyrion VIII)*\\n\\nWhy is Tyrion expressing that he\\'s sick of eating swan interesting to me? Because one of the Thompson\\'s other favorite PR-tested anecdotes was to talk about one of the hardships he\\'d endured while looking for the Ship of Gold: at one point having to eat fried chicken for every single meal for weeks on end. \"Not chicken again\" could\\'ve been his motto.\\n\\n\\n##Tinkerer &amp; Tinkers\\nAnother big PR talking point (we can infer) was that Thompson had always been a \"**tinkerer**\". A single 1989 profile quoted him as saying \"I was always a tinkerer\", talked about the remaining gold waiting for him \"to come back and start tinkering again\", and finally referred to him as \"the inveterate tinkerer\".\\n\\nThere\\'s only *one* use of anything like that term in the *ASOIAF* canon, and it\\'s smack in the middle of a passage—\\n&gt;In Volantis **he had seen the galleys taking on provisions. The whole city had seemed drunk. Sailors and soldiers and tinkers[!] had been observed dancing in the streets with nobles and fat merchants, and in every inn and winesink cups were being raised** to the new triarchs. **All the talk had been of the gold and gems** and slaves **that would flood into Volantis** once the dragon queen was dead. One day of such reports was all that Victarion Greyjoy could stomach; **he paid the gold price** for food and water, though it shamed him, and took his ships back out to sea. *(ADWD The Iron Suitor)*\\n\\n—that describes a scene suspiciously akin to the celebration when Thompson\\'s salvage ship returned to port with the first load of gold from the Ship of Gold, as reported in that same magazine profile on Thompson that called him a tinkerer three times and also by *The Washington Post*.\\n\\nThe \"nobles and fat merchants\" who seemed drunk and who were \"dancing in the streets\" seem like a riff on the \"cheering crowd of [Thompson\\'s] financial backers\" who were there waiting for him when his crew returned to port in 1989 — \"some of Central Ohio\\'s wealthiest citizens gathered to clap their hands\".\\n\\nWhere Victarion thinks \"the whole city… seemed drunk\", it seems like \"the whole city\" of Norfolk turned out to greet Thompson and company: we read about a \"cheering crowd\", a \"brass-band welcome\" from a local high school band, police, federal marshals, and a media circus. The *WaPo* article includes an anecdote which seems like grist for GRRM\\'s description of Volantis:\\n&gt;Genevieve Gross of North Olmsted, Ohio, the great-great-niece of Alvin Ellis, one of the 423 passengers lost on the *Central America,* **thanked the city of Norfolk for its kindness** to Ellis\\'s widow when she was put ashore here with other survivors without a penny to her name. **The city showered her with food and clothing, Gross said, the hotel where she landed waived her bill, and the innkeeper presented her with more than $700 in gold to help her when she left.**\\n\\nIt\\'s almost as if \"the whole city had [*been*] drunk\".\\n\\n*Immediately* before Victarion describes Volantis, drunk on talk of the gold that would soon \"flood into\" town (an approriate term if this is indeed a wink at the Ship of Gold coverage!), he declares in response to Wulfe\\'s proposal that \"another day [delay] might mean more another ship\" to add to the fleet:\\n&gt;\"Aye. And ten days might mean ten ships, or none at all. We have squandered too many days waiting on the sight of sails. Our victory will be that much the sweeter if we win it with a smaller fleet.\"\\n\\nIt just so happens that the *WaPo* piece about the cheering welcome party for Thompson talks of a similar number of days \"squandered\":\\n&gt;**The group lost more than a week** of operational work to Hurricane Hugo…\\n\\nAnd Victarion\\'s logic (a \"sweeter\" victory \"with a smaller fleet\") mirrors that of Thompson, who did what he did as a small, upstart firm, outracing other, far larger, established salvage firms to find the *Central America* with his single ship.\\n\\nAll that, right in the one and only spot where GRRM uses \"tinker\" — a key motif in Thompson\\'s carefully crafted, PR-deployed myth-making.\\n\\n\\n##Low-Profile Whiz Kids!\\nThe lede of *The Washington Post\\'s* PR-engineered July 18, 1987 story breaking the news of the find (\"TREASURE HUNTERS CLAIM $450 MILLION SHPWRECK\") spoke in breathless terms about the nous of Thompson\\'s team:\\n&gt;A partnership of low-profile treasure hunters, operating on the outer edge of ocean engineering technology, has laid claim to what it believes to be one of America\\'s most historic shipwrecks, a paddle-wheel steamer sunk in 1857 with some $450 million in gold coins from the California Gold Rush.\\n\\nAgain there\\'s an echo of Littlefinger\\'s supposed brilliance here. \"The outer edge of ocean engineering technology!\" Golly, it\\'s practically magic!\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the \"low-profile\" bit. In a lot of ways this recalls Tyrion\\'s description of Littlefinger skating by, under everybody\\'s radar:\\n&gt;No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone\\'s friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage. *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n##Mud\\nThe same article described the location in which the Ship of Gold was found as \"a vast, virtually featureless undersea mud flat\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth nothing that Littlefinger has a curious association with mud:\\n&gt;[Catelyn] remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\\'d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. *(AGOT Catelyn V)*\\n\\nCould that be a wink? It certainly seems like a metaphor for Littlefinger\\'s greed, which would fit.\\n\\n##Star Trek! The Wizard of Oz! \\nWhen the same *WaPo* shill/reporter wrote another feature on September 14, 1989 after being granted exclusive access to Thompson\\'s salvage ship when it began recovery operations, the language was exactly the kind of stuff that would attract a nerd like GRRM\\'s attention. I already quoted the \"Revenge of the Nerds\" language. There\\'s also a *Star Trek* reference:\\n&gt;It is driven from a control room in the bowels of this vessel, which, with its blinking monitors, glowing dials and multiple computer keyboards, could double for the cockpit of the starship Enterprise. \\n\\n(The 1992 *Life* story doubles up on the Star Trek bit, making me think this was another heavily manufactured angle. Thompson\\'s ship is said to have \"workmanlike gray decks\" but \"Stark Trek guts\" containing \"a wondrous world of technology\".)\\n\\nWe get a fantastic image of \"a mechanical Victorian dowager at underwater tea\", and a Wizard of Oz reference—\\n&gt;Working in a lightly silted area of the wreck they hadn\\'t touched before, they used Nemo\\'s water thrusters to blow away the underwater dust and suddenly saw what some aboard are already calling \"the yellow brick road.\"\\n\\n—which prefigures *ASOIAF* referencing the Wicked Witch of the West/East when \"Lady Olenna\\'s nasty little smile\" reminds Cersei of wicked witchy Maggi (from the Westerlands via Essos) while reminding *us* of a guy with an Olenna-esque \"nasty grin\" saying, improbably, \"my pretties\":\\n&gt;The third was armed only with a nasty grin. \"And where are you lot bound, my pretties?\" he asked. *(TWOW Arianne II)*\\n\\nAll that language could have sucked GRRM in.\\n\\n##\"Storybook Treasure In A Kid\\'s Book\"\\nThe most obvious GRRM-bait and *ASOIAF* tie-in, though, is the story\\'s headline — \\'STORYBOOK TREASURE\\' FOUND OFF SOUTH CAROLINA — and Thompson being quoted saying:\\n&gt;It\\'s just like a storybook treasure in a kid\\'s book.\\n\\nThis was a practiced line. The 1992 *Life* feature seemingly quotes Thompson\\'s apparently contemporanous description/log as the treasure was first being revealed by undersea camera like this:\\n&gt;The *Central America* looks truly like a storybook treasure.\\n\\nIf \"storybook treasure in a kid\\'s book\" doesn\\'t raise hackles I don\\'t know what would. Storybook stories a.k.a. \"songs\" are a constant touchstone in *ASOIAF*. *ASOAIF\\'s* constant theme that real life is not a story—\\n&gt;The fat leather-bound volume was full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. Children\\'s stories, if truth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history. *(ASOS Daenerys VI)*\\n\\n—is famously exemplified by none other than Littlefinger:\\n&gt;\"Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\" *(AGOT Sansa III)*\\n\\nIndeed, Littlefinger\\'s lesson seems drawn straight out of the reporting on the Ship of Gold as it stood when GRRM went to write *AGOT*: The vaunted \"storybook treasure\" Thompson had found via much ballyhooed technological brilliance and claimed in the 1989 *Post* article could be worth \"$1 billion\" was reported in universal coverage of a key court ruling c. November 1993 to be worth only $21 million — almost $10 million less than the $30 million the same court ruling said had been spent to recover it.\\n\\nThus the finding and recovery of the \"storybook treasure\" looked, in the years *AGOT* was being written, to be a boondoggle.\\n\\nI think GRRM almost \"confirms\" that the Ship of Gold affair (as it stood c. 1995) inspired him via Jon\\'s story in *AGOT*. Jon gets to the Wall and is told that life there isn\\'t like \"the stories your wet nurse told you\" (i.e. stories \"in a kid\\'s book\", in Thompson\\'s words):\\n&gt;\"Cold and hard and mean, that\\'s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse.\" *-Donal Noye (AGOT Jon III)*\\n\\nAnd then, before *AGOT* is through, he learns, of all things, that \"digging for buried treasure\" (a la Thompson\\'s search for sunken treasure) refers not to a child\\'s romantic notion of an adventure but rather to the sordid fact of fucking \"whores\" in a hole in the ground:\\n&gt;On the Wall, he\\'d heard men call the whores \"buried treasures.\" He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. *(AGOT Jon IX)*\\n***\\n&gt;\"You know where I\\'d be if it was me? I\\'d be in Mole\\'s Town, digging for buried treasure.\" Toad\\'s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon\\'s mare snorted. *(AGOT Jon IX)*\\n\\nOf course, the fact that \"whores\" and thus Hoares have just been conflated with buried treasure rather tends to support the idea that the Hoare sigil\\'s gold ship is indeed a reference to the sunken treasure of the Ship of Gold.\\n\\n##The Smell of Bullshit Begins\\nBacking up, on October 6 1989, the *WaPo* ran a follow-up piece on the return of Thompson\\'s salvage ship to port in Norfolk called \"TREASURE HUNTERS\\' GOLDEN MOMENT\", covering the massive press events Thompson\\'s PR people organized. It\\'s easy to read it and see how GRRM may have begun to view the supposed heroes of a children\\'s story come to life as possibly at least slightly full of shit. (A la Littlefinger.)\\n\\nThis gem comes near the beginning:\\n&gt;Citing scientific and technological byproducts of the group\\'s successful search for the U.S. Mail Ship Central America and its cargo from the California gold rush, Thompson told a cheering crowd of his financial backers that **\"we learned there are many kinds of treasure, and that\\'s the best discovery of all.\"**\\n\\nIt\\'s *possible* that Thompson\\'s unbelievebly cheesy, afterschool special-assed quote — was he *really* talking about \"scientific… byproducts\" or was he talking about \"the real treasure being the friends we made along the way\"? — *didn\\'t* inspire GRRM to write the following exchange in which Littlefinger basically mocks such schlocky notions of \"treaure\":\\n&gt;Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, **\"You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.\"**\\n\\n&gt;**\"Oh, now there\\'s a treasure,\" Littlefinger said**, exiting. *(AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n\\nBut I wouldn\\'t bet on it. If GRRM read this shit or watched TV coverage, he would\\'ve seen right through Thompson\\'s claims to altruism. *Obviously* the \"best discovery of all\" was the *literal fucking treasure*, not whatever high-minded crap they were trying to peddle to seem like they weren\\'t motivated by greed. (And *oh my god* was a skeptical outlook vindicted in the coming decades. But that\\'s another story.)\\n\\nMaybe Thompson\\'s line about other kinds of treasure didn\\'t inspire GRRM to have (ironborn, possible Hoare) Mance say this—\\n&gt;\"And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that **her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me.**\" *(ASOS Jon I)*\\n\\n—and, having thus equated a \"gift\" from a woman with \"treasure\", to have our boy Littlefinger talk about the another \"kind of treasure\" that he clearly *does* relish:\\n&gt;\"There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me . . . but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. But she gave me something finer, **a gift a woman can give but once.** How could I turn my back upon her daughter? *(ASOS Sansa V)*\\n\\nBut it could have. Especially in conjunction with e.g. the 1992 *Life* \"story\"/P.R.-release, which was literally called \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\".\\n\\n(Notice what Littlefinger is doing in that passage. He is almost certainly *bullshitting* the hell out of Sansa. He wants to *use* Sansa, and he wants to fuck her. He\\'s like Thompson, talking about how great the scientific advancements are and acting like the story isn\\'t that he maybe just made a billion dollars.)\\n\\nThe article closes with more saccharine schmaltz from one of Thompson\\'s junior partners… and Thompson doing something very, very familiar to *ASOIAF* readers:\\n&gt;**Thompson stroked his curly beard, grinned and mused in his laconic fashion: \"We hope to be rich.\"** Evans, however, said it wasn\\'t that simple. \"There are so many things of value produced by an expedition like this,\" the historian said. \"To me it\\'s become a kind of celebration of American ideals -- free enterprise, hard work and the exploration of a frontier. **\"And in that way,\" he said with a smile, \"we\\'re already rich.\"**\\n\\n***\\n##CONTINUED IN OLDEST REPLY',\n",

       "  'body': 'It is a weird way for them to measure it to be sure. I did read what they were trying to say and how they measure it. \"Factors affecting Latency: Scan Rate, Polling Rate, Response Time, Connection Type\" this part to be specific on the last site. It boggles me that they went to the length of effort on making and explaining that site but make no mention of the inherent variance of the keystroke. Surely they must have noticed that they can have a natural variance of 30-300ms on a keyboard? At that point any actual difference from the latency that there may or may not be between two products is completely lost in the noise.\\n\\nOn my G815 the press triggers instantly when the key starts to go down and I got quite a light touch and don\\'t really push it too aggressively resulting in huge delay according to that site (since it starts the timer when the press triggers but ends the timer when it bottoms out, eh why?). On one of the rubberdomes I tried I got consistently low times and I feel like it liked that one since it registers the start of the stroke later and almost at the same time as the end of the stroke. Subjectively I feel that that keyboard is my least responsive to type or to play on. I also tried a long press distance mechanical keyboard and got average results with it.\\n\\nTo sum it up G815 with short actuation mechanical the average was extremely high 180ms. Long actuation but low resistance mechanical K65 about 80ms (I feel like it liked this one since it doesn\\'t trigger the stroke immediately but rather lets me pick a bit of speed first, It\\'s not as snappy a keyboard as the G815 but oh well.) And the king of the hill was the K120 that I got as a travel / backup keyboard, that one is a blazing fast 30ms area (not bad for 10 euro keyboard hehe). The test really got the opposite result of the \"speed\" of the keyboards that I would rank them at. I can\\'t help but feel that it is comparing apples and oranges. A fun little exercise though :)',\n",

       "  'body': \"So I made a first draft of the build, let me know if you want to change any stuff or not. Added peripherals as well and made it to perform better than a 3060! The performance of the 6700xt is between a 3060 ti and 3070 in performance, sometimes outperforming the 3070 is some games because of more vram and optimization.\\n\\n[Klik hier om de onderdelen te zien (megekko winkelmand).](https://www.megekko.nl/wl/2QYEJ3AZ)\\n\\nSo the price of the pc build is €1300, far under your budget. This build is mostly meant for a 1080p monitor, but 1440p is easily possible. \\n\\nYou do have 1tb of fast 4.0 nvme storage, 32gb of white rgb ram, i5 13500, rx 6700xt, an aio (just went for it with argb fans in the front as well, can be changed) and actually a case I love so much.\\n\\nThe case has these flowers on the front panel, glass panel and I think on the back as well, but not overdone. I think it's actually such a cool edition, here is [a build done in it.](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0m8vDZvUQzxveV7aM48ZMLEKFVm9EkN6a4Vf7xkpyn3u3BfAjUWbgH4aMGYxf5VQcl&amp;id=278659922159897)\\n\\nSo for the peripherals:\\n\\n\\n1)Keyboard: I'm actually someone who loves custom keyboards, so if you want to do that let me know. There is a perfect prebuilt tho which I think you'll love and I am so digging those keycaps, it's the Akko Tokyo series.\\n[60% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-3061s-rgb)\\n[65% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-3068b-plus-mechanical-keyboard)\\n[75% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-3084b-plus-mechanical-keyboard?_pos=9&amp;_sid=1e02cbe8d&amp;_ss=r)\\n\\n\\n2) Deskmat: With a nice keyboard you need a nice deskmat. So of course from Akko the Tokyo deskmat would fit so well and looks so god dam good, but if you don't like it I'll be adding a site where I personally always get my deskmats.\\n[Tokyo Deskmat](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-mouse-pad?_pos=4&amp;_sid=1e02cbe8d&amp;_ss=r)\\n[Mykeyboard.eu in-stock deskmats](https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/category/accessories/desk-mat_71/?selected_facets=num_in_stock_exact%3A%5B1+TO+%2A%5D)\\n\\n\\n3) Mouse, I mean I'll just recommend pulsar. Fast and light mouses, great to use. They have a lot of versions, but first you have to know your mouse grip. [Check here what your mousegrip is.](https://voltcave.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mouse-grip-styles.jpg)\\n\\nBased on the grip choose between these mice:\\nPalm grip: Xlite V2\\nPalm grip with small hands or claw grip: Xlite v2 mini\\nFingertip grip or relaxed claw with small hands: X2 mini\\nRelaxed claw grip: X2\\n\\n\\n4) Monitor, I mean I chose [this](https://www.megekko.nl/product/2077/921387/Monitoren/Lenovo-G24-20-24-165Hz-IPS-gaming-monitor). It's cheap for what you get, 165hz and a nice IPS panel. Works great for the pc.\\n\\n5) Headphones. Pretty important. If you want good audio quality I would recommend getting studio headphones with a seperate microphone. You can have closed back and open back headphones, closed back gives a more noise control effect and has a deeper bass whereas open back has an overall more clear sound and leaks audio out of the headphones. I personally prefer open back, but yeah preference.\\n[Open back](https://www.amazon.nl/HIFIMAN-Magnetische-Hoofdtelefoon-Audiofielen-Gevoeligheid/dp/B08ZJM3N22/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?)\\n[Closed back](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07T5V699K/ref=asc_df_B07T5V699K1682735280000/)\\n\\nDo note that for the he400se, the sound will actually improve a lot if you use an [dac](https://www.wifimedia.eu/nl/ifi-audio-zen-air-dac.html?). \\n\\n7) Microphone, the [mpm1000u](https://www.amazon.nl/Marantz-Professional-MPM1000-Grootmembraan-Studio-Opname/dp/B01C05AL4C/ref=asc_df_B01C05AL4C/?) is great. Adding a boom arm is recommended, but up to you :)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, want different parts or anything else let me know! If you would like an ultrawide monitor for example or a 1440p monitor, we'll have to change that and change the build a bit to make it better for this higher resolution. The case airflow isn't great, but with these parts it'll be good enough.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Of course! [I own one](https://i.imgur.com/ilkRg3z.jpg), though it\\'s actually my second Nakaya. My point is it isn\\'t constructive to compare how much you *could* spend in two hobbies, because the answer for both is always essentially infinite.\\n\\nA more useful metric is how most people experience the hobby. That requires two points: what\\'s the cheapest you can \"get in to the hobby for\" (spend at least enough to get some idea of what the hobby is about and why people like it/might go deeper), and what\\'s the point at which you *can* spend more, but you won\\'t get any objectively better features.\\n\\nMost Nakayas are around $700~800. Of course there are the raden and maki-e models which scale well in to five figures... but those are art pieces. Can you really argue someone shopping for a TWSBI would get more for their money if they bought a $30,000 Nakaya? I could also commission a solid brass Austin or custom Keycult and then pay for it to be hand scrolled. That would probably be north of 10k but not enough people \"experience the hobby\" like that to make it worthwhile to discuss.\\n\\nFountain pens probably have a longer \"tail\" to be sure - they turn in to art pieces more than pens in the low thousands. Even Montblanc\\'s writer editions and great character editions fall in to this IMO, as do Pelikan\\'s limited edition Souveran pens.\\n\\nI can give someone a Platinum Preppy and an ink cartridge and they can get what the hobby is about for around $5. I can hand someone a Red Dragon mechanical and they can get what the hobby is about (at least a little bit), but the cheapest I see for those is around $35. I can see the case for something like a TWSBI Eco or Lamy Safari and a bottle of ink ($40~50) being \"the entry point\", but I\\'d actually argue that\\'s more where most people in the hobby reside and would be more akin to a Keychron Q1 or GMMK Pro build ($250 or so, once you account for switches &amp; caps). This is at a point where you\\'re deeper in to \"getting it\" so I don\\'t think a prebuilt makes sense from the keyboard side anymore.\\n\\nI would say you keep getting \"more from your money\" in the fountain pen space up until $200 or so. You can use a Pilot Custom as the example instead of the Lamy, it doesn\\'t really matter. Throw enough ink to last *years* in and some nice paper or a very nice bound book and you\\'re at maybe $300. Once you have a gold nib, solidly built pen from a well respected manufacturer, spending more stops buying you features. The equivalent in the keyboard space might be something like the QK75, plus keycaps from a real manufacturer instead of clones, and maybe some nicer switches like Oil Kings, Box Jades, or Boba U4Ts. Now that\\'s a $500 keyboard compared against a $200 pen.\\n\\nSo at the cheapest possible entry point we have about $5 vs. $35\\n\\nIn the low end we have $45 vs. $250\\n\\nAnd the point where our money stops objectively going way further we have $300 vs. $500\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I\\'d say that\\'s how most people \"experience\" the hobby, and why fountain pens are objectively noticeably cheaper.\\n\\nI\\'ve got Watermans, Pelikans, Montblancs, a Conid, a Nakaya, a handful of TWSBIs, a handful of Lamys, enough ink to last a lifetime. Ten years of buying pens and the average pen cost is probably around $300. Five years in keyboards, only one or two of which are arguably high end (Akko MOD 007, KBD67 Lite, NK87 alu, Metakey Tenet brass, Driftmechanics Forever65, Driftmechanics Austin, plus all the switches and caps I\\'ve bought), my average is pushing $700 per build.',\n",

       "  'body': ' Hello everyone, recently I decided to buy a Keychron Q6 (yes, size does matter to some). I\\'ve been using more or less everything in the past, from classic IBM keyboards with a DIN plug to fancy (and easily borked) Logitech peripherals. Now after my most recent G915 borked out I decided to go back to the type of keyboard I tend to love most, a nice mechanical one, partially since I had fond memories of my now ancient DAS Ultimate and the IBM\\'s of ancient history. Now.. here\\'s the thing.. I\\'ve been reading way too much on these forums which results in a severe case of FOMOM, fear of missing out mods, so... I\\'m looking for advice. The Keychron I bought came with \"OSA\" caps, a profile I didn\\'t expect to love, but well.. shoot me, I like the form and feel. I don\\'t however like the colors and the spacebar kind of makes a racket, so.. any tips for me? I\\'m looking for a combo keycap set that\\'s olive green + grey, doesn\\'t come with a 2 year wait, bonus points if it allows for backlight to shine through (no I don\\'t need the backlight, but it\\'s nice to have) and more than that, something with a spacebar that tocks instead of pings, tips that include a combo of two sets are perfectly fine as well. the profile I prefer is similar in height to the custom OSA of Keychron but the shape isn\\'t that important I guess. (Yes, you\\'re also allowed to tell me to go hunt unicorns instead, I get it). Any tips on better switches are also welcome, currently using the default Gateron linears that came with it, I prefer clicky, but.. these days there\\'s a baby asleep in the room next to me, so linear it is :P',\n",

       "  'body': \"Full size keyboard are becoming more common in the custom enthusiast space. It all started because a lot of people didn't need everything on a full size 104 key keyboard and sought to simplify things. Companies like IBM made the Space Saver Keyboard (SSK) versions of the Model M, but there weren't many in the early 2000s. Bringing back the TKL was first and it's gotten smaller since. Many find the benefits of a smaller main keyboard with a separate numpad to be the sweet spot in terms of usability.\\n\\nAs for media keys, which seems to be a major point for you, almost every enthusiast keyboard uses a form of re-programmable firmware. Most of them are QMK based, with compatibility for VIA/VIAL graphic interfaces, others use TMK or others depending on features and components used. This re-programmable firmware allows easy remapping of keys to be whatever you want. Different function layers for alternative layouts, use of omitted physical keys like F keys and nav keys on a 60/65%. You can program play/pause/skip/etc. wherever you want. The benefit of this is that the keyboard map is stored on the physical board and not in the software on your computer. Macros are also very easy to accomplish using these firmwares.\\n\\nI would say in the last five years or so, the emphasis in the custom keyboard space has been on sound and aesthetics. This can be seen in the sheer number of themed keycap group buys. That's not personally my cup of tea, I far prefer tasteful color accents and neutral tones.\\n\\nPrebuilts from gaming companies and the major computer manufacturers sometimes add dedicated media keys to help differentiate their product and sell more. But Corsair charging $200 plus for their shitty mechanical keyboards is asinine. There is little value in it, and aesthetic customization is often limited because they use non-standard keycap sizes.\\n\\nIf you want an inexpensive full-size keyboard, I'd recommend Keychron's Pro series K boards. They use a plastic chassis but have QMK/VIA compatibility, hotswap sockets for changing switches to your liking, and standard keycap sizes. You could get the K10 Pro with switches and a cheap keycap set to match your preferences for less than a Corsair K100.\\n\\nIf you want a nicer machined aluminum case, the Keychron Q6 is there for you. If you don't need the navigation cluster as much (or don't mind accessing it on a different layer) the Q5 is a compact fullsize layout called the 1800 layout.\",\n",

I really like the short travel of the keys, and the speed I can get on them.\\n\\nI have used several mechanical keyboards in search for a replacement (G915 and G513 linear), because you read a lot about the merrits of them. But in short, for me they are the shortcut to RSI. My hands hurt so much, no matter what palmrest I use, which height, etc.\\n\\nSo, I am looking for a keyboard with the same keys (or at least very similar keys) to the K750. I use an Belgium AZERTY layout with a large enter button. I do not want QUERTY or any other keyboard layout - I just do not want to switch. \\n\\nAny suggestions for a good replacement keyboard? I seem not to be able to find any K750 AZERTY BE keyboards anymore.\\n\\nThe keys on the K750 are a bit \\'slow\\' (if that means something to you). Maybe, if a keyboard exists that is a bit \"faster\", but with a similar key style, that would be awesome. Any tips are very, very much appreciated (because my hands fucking hurt).',\n",

[Colorful keyboards](https://igearworld.com/product/keybee/) are smaller and may not contain a number pad or other keys, whereas full-size keyboards feature all the keys, including a number pad. When choosing a size, take into account your particular preferences and work space.  \\n**Backlighting**: Think about a keyboard with LED backlighting if you want to use your keyboard in low light or just enjoy the way it looks. Even customized lighting effects are available on certain keyboards.  \\n**Connectivity**: Keyboards can be connected to your computer using Bluetooth, USB, or other wireless protocols. Think about your configuration and if a wired or wireless connection is best for you.  \\n**Price**: Keyboards can cost anything from $20 and several hundred dollars. Choosing a keyboard should take your budget into account.  \\n**Here are some prominent keyboard alternatives to keep in mind**:  \\n**Logitech K810**: This wireless keyboard is a fantastic choice for typing in dim light because it is small and illuminated.  \\n**iGear**: This mechanical wireless keyboard has adjustable illumination and a sturdy design. A renowned firms that has launched a colorful keyboard which is not just good-looking but also work well with most computer systems.  \\nMicrosoft Surface Keyboard: Designed specifically for Surface users, this wireless keyboard has a full-size layout and silent, low-profile keys.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '**Genre: Industrial Metal/Groove Metal**\\n\\n**Release Date: 16th June 1995**\\n\\n**Streaming:**\\n\\n* [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/demanufacture-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/1565825965)\\n* [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/65GdWk0paVbY04benEKKIU?autoplay=true)\\n* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/vL4deQWh1mc)\\n\\n**Review: (**[**Ghostcultmag**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/) **-** [**Keefy**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/author/keefyadmin/)**)** \\n\\nMany times in music journalism, we writers are given to hyperbole, often because it is the low hanging fruit of the field to gush about the classics with a torrent of compliments. You often read words like *genre-defying,* and frankly, a lot of the time they don’t land as they are meant to. However, in the case of the entire career of **Fear Factory** and certainty of the album *Demanufacture* (**Roadrunner Records**), the words can never do proper justice to the music. Simply stated, *Deamnfacture* is one of the most important, unique, and unapologetically brutal albums in heavy metal history.\\n\\nFear Factory was already ahead of its time with its legendary demo, produced by **Ross Robinson**, their debut *Soul of A New Machine*, and their inventive remix album *Fear is the Mindkiller* (both Roadrunner). So clearly they were building up to something grandiose for their pivotal third release. How much of game-changer this album would have been tough to predict at the time, but after its release would go on to be impossible to deny.\\n\\nWe could write this entire retrospective about the title track ‘Demanufacture’ alone. Everything about the song was next level big. The one of a kind right-hand chugs, the uncanny riffs, powerful and technical drumming, and **Burton C. Bell’s** unique vocals, fully come into his own just in the first few minutes of the song. It is as good an opening track on any album in the entire decade of the 1990s. The track clearly set the template that not only was this a vastly improved effort for the band, you were hearing something truly brand new and life-affirming. A sound that could change your very DNA, and would impact how metal was created and recorded afterward.\\n\\nThe album continues going from strength to strength, as complex riffs, inventive melodies, and brutal parts just smash your earpiece. And the hooks! Even the heaviest songs on *Demanufacture* have amazing hooks and memorable, sing-a-long parts. You can’t really even say that about the majority of extreme metal, which is why the band’s popularity exploded.\\n\\nSongs like Self ‘Bias Resistor’ and ‘Zero Signal’ we just thick with drama and intensity. The terrific extra-musical parts from sequencers, and keyboards, movie sound effects, and other ear candy owed as much to the suffocating Orwellian dystopia of movies like *Blade Runne*r (a prior influence) and [***The Terminator***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpMg1upld0w) franchise, in which the band clearly interpolated both musically and aesthetically. Frequent collaborator Rhys Fulber (F**ront Line Assembly**) and **Reynor Diego** added a lot of the synths and practical samples, along with Bell. The man versus machine battle played out over eleven tracks is brilliant and foreshadowed our current society in a prescient way. In [**Ghost Cult’s 2016 interview**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/interview-dino-cazares-of-fear-factory-the-future-is-here/) with **Dino Cazares**, he laid out his vision for what they were going for conceptually: \\n\\n“***On this record, what we wanted to talk about was not the man versus the machine but the man and the machine becoming one. The singularity process would actually be where man and machine have become one. In other words, they are able to create a cell – a little mechanical cell that they could inject into your body…like certain diseases that you have in your body, like cancer cells or obviously nano-technology. So once they perfect that…what’s next? Man and machine becoming one, and that’s what we’re talking*** ***about on this one.”***\\n\\n“***Actually even when you’ve got people like Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Hawking talking about the singularity process, they’ll also try to stop it, which is kind of ironic.”***\\n\\n***“Remember the whole cloning wars when everybody was cloning sheep and dogs? They put a law that you couldn’t do that. Obviously you’re going to be able to clone a human. You pretty much can already, but there’s a law against it. That’s pretty much what they think that is going to happen in the near future where they’re going to put a law against technology and humans becoming one.”*** \\n\\nArguably the bands’ best known and best overall track ‘Replica,’ was a minor hit on metal radio, the video was in rotation at **MTV’s Headbangers Ball,** and the song became a trademark for the band. Bell was never more heartfelt, impactful, or dynamic in his delivery and the track is just bliss to all headbangers. Bell’s vocal style and his deft ability to swap back and forth between melody and guttural vocals grew a wave of imitators, that ven found its way into mainstream metalcore and rock decades later.\\n\\nNormally most bands have a top-heavy album that falls off in the middle, but not **FF.** ‘New Breed’ is almost a thrash death metal mash-up with a hypnotic beat that just sucks you in. Next up, their cover of **Head of David’s** ‘Dog Day Sunrise’ is a fan favorite, and owes a lot to their kinship with all of **Godflesh** and (HoD)’s **Justin Broadrick** musically and as genre leaders.\\n\\n‘Body Hammer’ almost has a New York Hardcore riff to it, and maybe it’s just me, but the machine sounds during the song my have influenced the MCU’s *Iron Man* movie when Tony Stark makes the first suit in a cave and [**hammers the metal parts into shape**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHU49CD0TOs). Another great song. ‘Flashpoint’ is short and has a very 1980s proto-industrial metal *Musiq-concrete* style that I like. ‘Pisschrist’ is another deep cut that could have been the best song on any other album and a personal favorite of mine to this day.\\n\\nWith the epic closing track ‘A Therapy For Pain’ the band displayed their full vision, changing what was possible for many bands making heavy music. The set the standard and would be not only an influence on progressive metal and death metal bands in that decade such as **Meshuggah** and **Mnemic**, but they would also shape several subgenres such as melodic death metal (**At The Gates**, early **Soilwork**), **Static-X** and more commercial industrial bands) as well. They birthed a vision uncluttered and sleek, ready to be spoon-fed into our frontal lobes. Not even the biggest bands of the decade like **Metallica, Pantera, Slipknot,** and **Type O Negative**, all with multiple major releases in the genre could overshadow the greatness of this album. It was definitely a combined team effort from the band, and without a doubt in the pantheon of greatest albums ever. And that is no exaggeration at all. \\n\\n**Discussion Ideas:**\\n\\n* Praise?\\n* Criticisms?\\n* Personal experiences\\n* Best/Worst tracks?\\n* Has the album impacted the Metal scene?\\n* How has the artist evolved and was/is it a good direction?',\n",

       "  'body': 'In my opinion!\\n\\n[Mechanical keyboards](https://www.wadav.com/coupons/mechanical-keyboards?track=Wadav-red) are a type of computer keyboard that use individual mechanical switches under each key instead of a rubber membrane or dome. These switches provide a tactile and audible feedback when pressed, which many users find more satisfying and comfortable than the softer, quieter feel of traditional keyboards. Mechanical keyboards are also known for their durability and long lifespan, as the switches are typically rated for tens of millions of keystrokes.   \\n\\n#',\n",

These types of keys feel different to press but there are also sub-categories of them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;and how can i find out the difference?\\n\\nYou can simply google the model of your keyboard and you should be able to find this out really easily.',\n",

       "  'body': \"The detection mechanism is the limitation for membrane keyboards, IIRC. For mechanical keyboards you'd be hard-pressed to find one that didn't have theoretical NKRO support (no ghosting in the hardware level). The only other piece of the puzzle is that you have to use the extended USB keyboard spec to report key state with larger data packets, rather than the legacy keyboard spec. NKRO isn't supported by the host in BIOS (dunno about UEFI) so a keyboard with NKRO enabled might not function in the BIOS screens. But every modern operating system has native support for the extended reporting. Most commercial gamer keyboards have a toggle switch for NKRO so it'll still work in BIOS if you turn NKRO off. Same in QMK, et al. They have functions to toggle it and you can set it up to be on by default.\\n\\nThe main reason most don't have it enabled by default/all the time is the BIOS thing coupled with the fact that 6KRO is almost always enough.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"1. Dust filters. The less dust gets in your case, the better. Vacuuming the floor around the PC helps. May want to clean the dust off from time to time anyway, as some very small quantities will still get it and accumulate over time.\\n2. Keep liquids off, especially with cases with top mesh or fan opening, but projectile fluids can get in from any direction anyway depending on where you are when you spill them, so just keep the PC somewhere it can't be reached if you spill a coffee. Same goes for mechanical keyboards.\\n3. Keeps pets and children off. Risks are minimal when supervised, but don't underestimate the combined effect of creativity, curiosity and many hours of unsupervised time near the PC. (Kind of like managing room/floor fans with pets and children. The risk is usually low, but you don't want prolonged unsupervised exposure.)\\n4. No CPU installation or any other fragile work when you're tired, sleep, distracted, angry, hurried, jittery, high on caffeine, or after a beer or two. Watch the pins, watch the paste. No hurried jobs. Keep the emotions in check if you need to take the CPU out and put it back in — no more than 2 or 3 unsuccessful attempts in a row is my rule. Treat emotions like responsible drivers treat alcohol. They work kinda the same.\\n5. PSU: You don't have to buy 1200W Titanium, but I wouldn't go below Gold and like 200W surplus. Prefer PSUs that allow you to switch the fan off completely, even manually, to avoid wasting its working hours because PSU fans are a pain to replace. Listen to any new PSU through a vacuum-cleaner pipe or toilet-paper roll to make sure you don't hear coil whine and/or some other nasty sounds. (Do the same acoustic test for GPUs always, and you may want to do it also for soundcards and certain parts of motherboards if you're highly sensitive to sound. But PSU and GPU is kinda mandatory if you're a normal person with the PC case sitting close to where you sit, even several metres/yards).\\n6. This one isn't really about PC health/maintenance, but it comes close and is related: Check manuals and specs and take precise measurements to make sure everything is compatible and there's space for everything. This is less of a problem these days that the stores accept returns more readily but anyway. Don't assume anything, don't rely on calculations based on manual specs if they outcome suggests something like 2mm clearance. Don't brute-force anything unless you really know what you're doing and can manage the financial risk involved.\\n7. The bottom-line takeaway is mostly to avoid doing stupid things or taking stupid risks. Everybody knows this rule, obviously, and mostly follows it, but the difficult task is to control oneself and avoid making exceptions when you're in a hurry or get emotional. **Sticking with the 'don't do stupid' rule 100% of the time as opposed to 99% is the challenge.**\",\n",

I\\'ve owned a few mechanical keyboards and bought this because my work mouse is an mx master 3.\\n\\nI regret buying it because I just have seen other keyboards do everything better and from a big company like Logitech I expect more.\\n\\n1. Backlight\\n\\n1a. Unless it\\'s plugged in you can\\'t always have the backlight on. If you\\'re plugging it in why buy a wireless keyboard?\\n1b. The timeout of the lights for the keyboards is 30 seconds and this is not changeable. Now I\\'m a developer so sometimes I\\'m just looking at my code and not typing and when I get ready to type if I had my hand on the keyboard I have to press something for the lights to come on. If my hand wasn\\'t on it fine I just need to hover my hand to turn on the lights but that still takes a second.\\n1c. It wouldn\\'t bother me that much if not for a and b but you only get white lights. Sure I typically only use wight or blue static lights but you are spending 100+ on the keyboard the lights don\\'t stay on and it\\'s only white lights that honestly aren\\'t that bright.\\n\\n2.compatibility with other logitech products \\n2a. The receiver is a logibolt which believe it or not does not work with the majority of productivity mice of logitech. Not the mx master or the triathlon I have. Which is fine if you want to use Bluetooth but at work Bluetooth messes up frequently so that means I need 2 recievers as the keyboard is also not compatible with the unifying receiver. Both the unifying receiver and logibolt receiver are things logitech brags about they don\\'t seem to have put to much effort into them.\\n2b. Flow. All the items I\\'ve mentioned are \"compatible\" with logitech flow. The mice \"work\" but do not switch over the keyboard with them most times. It\\'s maddening because I bought a k380 to test flow before this and that works most time but not this keyboard.\\n2c. Easy switch does not switch the mouse. It\\'s another one of those things that you would think would work and when it doesn\\'t you wonder why u stuck with one brand. I\\'m not gonna mention another brand in this comment but I will say there is another low profile mechanical keyboard with multi device that happens to have some orange keycaps exists I\\'ve tested it and I honestly I should have stuck to.\\n\\n3. It\\'s not the best feeling blue switches\\nI can\\'t speak to the other colors (red or brown) because I don\\'t own them but of the 4 mechanical keyboards I own/owned this only really feels better than the $50 one\\n\\n\\nTldr. The keyboard does everything it says it does and does none of those things well and at its price you really ot to just buy something else or if muti device isn\\'t why you are buying it get a kit and have some fun making your own mechanical keyboard',\n",

Finally, each piece is hand-polished to a smooth, matte-glossy finish, revealing the striking patterns and textures of the fucking rainybow.\\n\\nUniqe Wooden Keycap with OEMR4 profile  \\nCherry **like** Stem (infos in the form)  \\nPrice per keycap: 70€\\xa0 +ca.17€ DHL international shipping (2-4 weeks)  \\nForm Closes: Saturday May 2nd @ 12PM UTC\\n\\nGallery: [https://imgur.com/a/66LYQJR](https://imgur.com/a/66LYQJR)\\n\\nRaffle Form: [https://forms.gle/DVT2k7iUR8wvDgQi7](https://forms.gle/DVT2k7iUR8wvDgQi7) Closes: Tuseday May 8th @ 12PM UTC  \\n\\n\\nBackstorry  \\nI am incredibly happy to finally offer the Wooden Rainbow Keycap. I like  to work with wood and the transience of this material... especially  within a hobby that - to be honest ;) - nobody actually needs... I think  it's nicer to not add to the man-made waste pile. This is why I  embarked on a journey to add a renewable option to the beautiful world  of Artisan Keycaps. You guys seemed to like the idea... and sparked me  with energy to pursue my little project.

It has to be wireless and full-size. I'm not very acquainted with mechanical keyboards (so i would prefer to avoid any DIY) and I'm thinking of using brown switches. Found out about the Keychron K10 PRO, haven't tried it irl yet but i really like how it looks. Does anyone have any cheaper/better suggestions of full-size wireless keyboards?\",\n",

       "  'body': 'After a lifetime of my younger brother receiving my hand-me-down PCs as I upgraded, and after years of him not even owning his own PC or even Mac laptop, I decided that PC gaming would be a fun way to reconnect long-distance with him. My original plan was to build myself an upgraded system and give him my current one, but to be honest my current system is more than enough for my needs and meaningfully upgrading would\\'ve been very expensive. Instead, I decided to build him his own with (mostly) all-new hardware. But just to exercise my older brother privilege, I did swap out my PC\\'s PSU for a 750W model and gave him my old 600W one. I\\'m also giving him a spare Dell G-SYNC 144Hz 27\" 1440p monitor that\\'s not very good (TN panel, bad viewing angles), but will be replacing it with my Acer Predator 27\" 144Hz GSYNC monitor once my Dough Spectrum OLED arrives to replace it.\\n\\nTo make up for the hand-me-downs, I supplied a custom-built, hand-lubed mechanical keyboard, a new Logitech mouse, and an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller.\\n\\n**Parts Summary:**\\n\\n* Velkase Velka 7 (6.9L) v2.1 case w/ PCIe 4.0 riser cable\\n* Gigabyte B550I AORUS Pro AX ITX motherboard (Rev 1.2)\\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600 CPU (PBO undervolted, -20 offset all cores, +200MHz)\\n* 32GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3600 CL16 RAM\\n* Alpenföhn Black Ridge CPU cooler, w/ swapped Noctua NF-A9x14 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) fan\\n* MSI Ventus 2x RTX 4070 OC, deshrouded + 2x Noctua NF-A12x15 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black) fans\\n* 2TB Western Digital SN770 SSD\\n* Corsair SF600 80Plus Platinum PSU\\n* Keychron Q2 Pro keyboard in e-white, w/ Keychron K Pro Silent Brown switches (hand-lubed by me), orange &amp; white PBT dye-sub keycaps\\n* Kraken keyboards aviator-style orange  coiled USB-C cable\\n* Logitch G PRO X Superlight mouse\\n* Microsoft Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller + the Elite Series 2 accessory kit (carrying case, paddles, replacement D-pad, charger, etc.)\\n\\n**The Build:**\\n\\nI previously built my gaming PC in an NCase M1 v6.1 with very similar parts (earlier revision of the same motherboard, a 5600X, same RAM, and a leftover 1080 that I later replaced with a 3080 12GB after GPU prices came down last year), which was the first time I\\'d built anything in the ITX/SFF arena. I guess I got bit by the bug, because I can\\'t imagine building in a full-size case again, at least for this sort of machine. Building SFF is just too much fun!\\n\\nI decided for this machine I wanted to go even smaller than the NCase\\'s nearly 13L while still maintaining reasonable thermals, and without saddling my brother with significantly worse performance than my own PC. Although I feel NVIDIA\\'s RTX 4070 is not the best value at $600, the efficiency bump it represented over my own 3080 12GB while maintaining equivalent performance seemed like the perfect GPU to fit into an even smaller case. I was originally looking at the Velka 5, but it was out of stock pending a refresh, and the requirement of the Flex-ATX power supply struck me as non-ideal for noise. So I went for the Velka 7, which at a scant 5.9L was still by far the smallest case I\\'d ever built in, but I felt would offer a good balance between diminutive size and decent noise/thermals.\\n\\nI also decided to stick with Zen 3 because the Alpenföhn Black Ridge doesn\\'t support the new AM5 socket mounting mechanism, and because going with Zen 3 parts allowed me to save considerably on all the core parts; the CPU, motherboard, and RAM were all notably cheaper by sticking with the previous generation, and at 1440p I don\\'t think going bleeding edge is really necessary.\\n\\nThe build itself was very fun, albeit a bit challenging given the tight spaces involved. I had to remove both the motherboard\\'s backplate and the M.2 heatsink included with the board to avoid interference with the PCIe riser cable routing and the CPU cooler\\'s fan, respectively. And the process of actually getting the assembled \"compute brick\" (what I\\'ve taken to calling the sandwich-layout motherboard + GPU assembly) inside the case took a bit of finagling, with all the display extension cables needing to be pre-plugged and routed prior to installation. That said, I wouldn\\'t describe it as painful by any stretch, and the case is quite well made.\\n\\nThe last tricky bit was the GPU. Having had great luck with de-shrouding my 3080 12GB in the NCase and using two bottom-mounted Noctua NF-A12x25s to cool it effectively and quietly, I wanted to try a similar thing with this GPU. Despite having a maximum power draw of only 200W vs my 3080\\'s 350W, I suspected using 2x 120mm fans, albeit slim ones, would still allow for much quieter cooling than the 2-slot card\\'s native shroud and fans. I was so confident about this I didn\\'t even test the card\\'s own cooler, I just took it off before ever powering it on. I also initially zip-tied the fans to the side panel, which made installation a little tricky and wound up with little zip-ties sticking out of the side panel.\\n\\nInitially, I had both fans plugged into the GPU\\'s on-board header with a CRJ micro 4-pin PWM dual fan splitter. However, I found that for whatever reason, the on-board fan controller wouldn\\'t spin the two fans any slower than 1300RPM. While not exactly *loud*, I wouldn\\'t describe that speed as \"quiet\" either. Annoyed, I slapped a couple LNA adapters between the splitter and the fans, which weirdly made zero difference. They spun up slower, but the card still insisted on running them at 1300RPM minimum. Annoyed, I pulled them out and put the stock cooler back on the card for testing. While it wasn\\'t annoyingly loud, it was still louder than I wanted.\\n\\nEncouraged by some online friends to try out FanControl, I again removed the stock GPU cooler and re-installed the fans, this time connecting them via a fan cable + splitter routed from the motherboard\\'s \"System 1\" header around to the GPU side of the case. Immediately I was able to spin them down as low as a scant 250RPM, which was completely inaudible. After more testing and tweaking, I found a great balance between effective cooling performance and acceptably quiet noise levels. I also found that I was able to simply pressure-fit the fans between the GPU and the side panel, and while I probably wouldn\\'t trust that for shipping in the mail, they seem perfectly stable for \"sitting on a desk\" duty.\\n\\nMy last tweaking test was to see if reversing the GPU fans from intake to exhaust would help pull a little extra hot air from the CPU side of the case via overall negative pressure. However, unfortunately because of the design of the Noctua fans and the GPU\\'s heatsink not going from fan corner to fan corner, the lower fan\\'s blades interfered with the heatsink and stopped spinning. So I\\'m stuck with intake, since the exhaust side has a built-in grille which protects the fan blades, and the intake side has all four rubber pads making contact with the side panel.\\n\\n**Thermal Performance:**\\n\\nAs a \\\\~6L case, the Velka 7 doesn\\'t have a whole lot of room to breathe, especially on the CPU side. CPU temps are correspondingly warm, typically stabilizing in the 72–75°C range during gaming loads. All-core CPU heavy activity can push the CPU up to 80°C at its 77W power limit, though as a gaming-focused system I doubt this will be much of a concern most of the time. Even this is well below TJMax.\\n\\nGPU temperatures are much nicer. The 4070\\'s low power draw is made even lower by a so-far rock solid stable 2640MHz @ 910mV undervolt, with Unigine\\'s Superposition benchmark sitting around 132W draw and 65°C, with the two Noctua fans whirring quietly at a sedate 1055RPM. Real-time ray tracing benchmarks can push the power draw up to 160W, with the fans getting slightly more audible in the 1100RPM range and temperatures sitting closer to 69°C (nice).',\n",

Going from a membrane keyboard to mechanical may give you a slight improvement since the force required to press a key is lower on mechanical keyboards (usually). \\n\\nThe general consensus is that linear switches are best for gaming. Most keyboards come with the option of linear, tactile, and clicky. But the best switch is the one you like most. The switches are the primary thing that changes the way a keyboard feels, not the keyboard itself, so I’d recommend going to Best Buy or micro center or somewhere like that to test out some keyboards and decide what feels best to you. If you want the absolute lowest possible latency, look for optical switches. But just so you know the difference will be basically imperceivable from a regular switch.\\n\\nSome recommendations I would give are anything by Keychron, they’re inexpensive and consistently good quality.

       "  'selftext': 'As part of a writing floating the notion that Littlefinger has Hoare blood — (see [[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/12ofe7x/a_gold_ship_silver_chains_littlefinger_the_sigil/) — I discussed how each aspect of House Hoare\\'s sigil might hint that Littlefinger is a Hoare, noting that Littlefinger himself does something similar vis-a-vis Orton Merryweather and his sigil:\\n&gt;Petyr had once remarked that the horn of plenty that adorned House Merryweather\\'s arms suited Lord Orton admirably, since he had carrot-colored hair, a nose as bulbous as a beetroot, and pease porridge for wits. *(AFFC Cersei IV)*\\n\\nHere, I want to delve further into my suspicion that the \"gold longship on black\" portion of the Hoare sigil is (at least in some significant part) a reference to the [[*S.S. Central America* a.k.a. \"The Ship of Gold\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Central_America)].\\n\\nThe so-called Ship of Gold was a gold-laden ship that was sunk in 1857 in a storm 200 miles off the Carolina coast and lost 8000 feet down in the inky-black depths of the Atlantic Ocean until it was located in 1987 by an upstart team of young treasure hunters from Columbus, Ohio (of all places) led by a guy named Tommy Thompson. I suspect that Littlefinger\\'s character and in some ways his story may have been inspired in some significant part — although not entirely or even primarily — by the story of Thompson and the recovery of the sunken treasure from that ship as it was known c. 1995, when GRRM began writing *AGOT*. At bare minimum, I think GRRM recognized the resonances between the story of Thompson and the Ship of Gold and Littlefinger\\'s story by the time he designed the sigil of House Hoare (which was done c. May 1999, per my direct correspondance with Linda Antonsson).\\n\\nIf I\\'m right that Littlefinger has Hoare blood and Targaryen blood, his story is in some sense that of a man attempting to reclaim and recover what he may see as lost wealth and power (including that of the Hoares) that is rightfully his, right? There is a \"rhyme\" between this idea and that of recovering a long-lost treasure from the ocean floor. Especially because the story of the \"Ship of Gold\" as it stood c. 1995 involved a high-profile court battle for possession of the treasure between the clever young media-savvy treasure hunters who found, recovered and claimed the lost gold by right of abandonment and discovery — and who did everything they could to win the public\\'s support as adventuring heroes on a quest for a storybook treasure — and the legal \"heirs\" of the parties who held the rights to the gold after the ship was sunk in 1857 and sought to, from their perspective, *re*-claim via argument what they said was rightly theirs.\\n\\nThe finding of the Ship of Gold was big news when it was first announced in 1987, and bigger news when substantial gold was recovered in 1989. Database searches show headlines in hundreds of papers, and I have vague memories of television news coverage which I at present have no way to confirm. (I did find a Tonight Show appearance by one of the members of Thomspon\\'s crew [[on youtube](https://youtu.be/Det4qrOXvxE)].)\\n\\nThe \"Ship of Gold\" continued to make news in the early 90s as bunch of insurance companies — the legal \"heirs\" of the original insurers of the 1857 ship and its cargo of gold — sued the treasure finders, claiming the recovered treasure was actually theirs by rights. See e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/07/18/treasure-hunters-claim-450-million-shpwreck/5b2d53be-f770-4561-b514-5247b2e50777/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/14/storybook-treasure-found-off-south-carolina/e59459ac-31d6-4546-a482-18aaad62dafe/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/10/06/treasure-hunters-golden-moment/98812bc7-abc9-4b9f-abec-e51f5a97b811/, https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2014/10/21/treasure-hunt-on-high-seas/9315335007/, https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/us/a-treasure-from-the-seas-but-whose.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/08/15/the-law-of-finders-keepers/716ca9f2-6c80-4410-bb06-4a66000a4582/, https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/28/us/insurers-to-share-shipwreck-s-gold.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/03/23/sunken-treasure-bounty-to-be-shared-with-heirs/a1ae96c9-d9c9-4e46-843e-bafda4071c88/, and especially this 1993 story, which alludes to and quotes some of the massive contemporaneous press coverage: https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19930627-1993-06-27-9306270057-story.html. A big story on the find in the March 1992 issue of then-ubiquitous *Life* magazine isn\\'t available online, but I got it from the library.\\n\\nThis writing will attempt to tease out various indications that Littlefinger\\'s story has something to do with this famous story of shipwreck and lost treasure. I figure I\\'ll start with two bits of low-hanging fruit.\\n\\n##Ships Sinking In Storms\\nHere\\'s the first line of a big March 1992 *Life* magazine feature on The Ship of Gold titled \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\". It opens with the tale of the Ship of Gold sinking in a storm in the fall of 1857:\\n&gt;A week out of Panama, on her 44th trip to New York, the *Central America* rounded the Flordia Keys and **ran smack in to a horrendous hurricane.**\\n\\nIsn\\'t curious, then, that there\\'s a \"throwaway\" line in *ASOS Tyrion VI* in which Tyrion wishes that Littlefinger\\'s ship would \"r[u]n into a storm at sea and s[i]nk\"?\\n&gt;He wondered if Petyr Baelish had reached the Vale yet. If the gods are good, he **ran into a storm at sea and sank.** But when had the gods ever been especially good?\\n\\nEspecially when Littlefinger\\'s *Merling King* is (as I argued in my main post discussing the Hoare sigil) a kind of \"Ship of Gold\", in that it transports \"Arbor Gold\" to the Vale.\\n\\n##Ship Insurance &amp; Wreckers\\nIf any one thing makes me truly *believe* that GRRM has written *ASOIAF* with the Ship of Gold saga in mind, it\\'s that *ADWD* \"just so happens\" to foreground two seemingly obscure notions, both of which are absolutely central elements of the \"Ship of Gold\" saga: (1) ship\\'s insurance and (2) \"wreckers\" who recover the wealth of shipwrecks.\\n\\nThe headline-making lawsuits about the Ship of Gold were all about a bunch of insurance companies — the heirs of the companies that sold ship\\'s insurance related to the *S.S. Central America* — suing the plucky storybook-come-true treasure finders. The insurance companies were pretty thoroughly villainized in the media.\\n\\nIn *ADWD The Ugly Little Girl,* Arya kills a man who insures ship\\'s cargos but doesn\\'t pay off when a shipwreck happens, and in *ADWD Tyrion VII* it\\'s mentioned that \"Vogarro\\'s whore\" (sounds like Hoare!) — a fabulously wealthy woman of low-birth whose business operations seem as variegated as those of the poor-boy-made-good Littlefinger — \"insured shipowners\". What a strange thing to repeatedly bring up in a fantasy novel… *unless* you\\'re riffing on a real-life story that involved ship\\'s insurance.\\n\\nAlso in *ADWD* — in *Davos I* — Davos visits the \"robber lord and wrecker\" Lord Borrell in Sisteron on Sweetsister. The entire story of the Ship of Gold was triggered, of course, by a wrecker (in the more benign sense of \"a person or vessel employed in recovering salvage from wrecked or disabled vessels\"), Thompson, finding the wreck of all wrecks. To the insurance companies, of course, he was a \"robber\", but to most of the public, the insurance companies challenging Thompson\\'s claim in court were, in effect, \"robber lords\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth nothing that GRRM paints both the wreckers—\\n&gt;The beacons that burned along the shores of the Three Sisters were supposed to warn of shoals and reefs and rocks and lead the way to safety, but on stormy nights and foggy ones, some Sistermen would use false lights to draw unwary captains to their doom. *(ADWD Davos I)*\\n\\n—and insurers—\\n&gt;\"He is writing each a binder. If their ships are lost in a storm or taken by pirates, he promises to pay them for the value of the vessel and all its contents.\" … \"No doubt many a captain sinking in a storm has taken some small solace in his binder back in Braavos, knowing that his widow and children will not want.\" A sad smile touched his lips. \"It is one thing to write such a binder, though, and another to make good on it.\" *(ADWD The Ugly Little Girl)*\\n\\n—as shady operators. Like Littlefinger, then.\\n\\n##Pirates! Littlefingerian Pirates!\\n&gt;Two hundred miles off the Carolina coast, on the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream (they will tell you this much, but no more, for even in the 1990s they worry about pirates)… *(Life Magazine \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\")*\\n\\nThe colorful media coverage often mentioned potential piracy — recall that \"the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves\" *(ASOS Samwell V)* — both literal (in terms of competing salvage teams trying to loot the wreck after it was located) and more figurative, i.e. of a type that \"rhymes\" with the type of pen-and-ink-and-bullshit \"war\" Littlefinger likes to conduct:\\n&gt;Now that they\\'d rescued the treasure, the explorers were taking no chances — potential pirates lurked at every turn.\\n\\n&gt;By now, however, they felt that \"pirates\" of another sort — not with swords and eye patches, but with ties and legal briefs — posed the real threat. *(Newport News Daily Press June 26, 1993 \"Tarnished Treasure\", linked above)*\\n\\nWhen courts found in favor of the insurance companies, it was not a popular decision, and these legal \"heirs\" were denounced as \"pirates\":\\n&gt;Editorial writers across the country denounced the decision.\\n\\n&gt;\"Ah, the ancient call of the open sea, in the days when men were men and Blackbeard sailed the bounding main!\" the Oakland Tribune wrote. \"Alas, there are landlubbing pirates afoot these days who would make Captain Hook look limp-hooked. They are called lawyers and insurers.\"\\n\\n&gt;Another editorial writer saw the insurance lawyers as \"pirates in pinstripes.\" *(ibid.)*\\n\\nOf course, from the perspective of the insurance companies and ultimately the courts (at least to a degree — see below), the real and far more literal pirate was Tommy Thompson. His group found the treasure, and he fought tooth and nail in court to keep it with no claim to title other than \"finders keepers\". From the perspective of the wealthy, powerful insurance establishment (and ultimately the legal establishment — at least technically), Thompsons\\'s refusal to return *any* of the treasure to its legal \"heirs\" was itself something of an act of ironborn-ish piracy itself. (Think here about Littlefinger wrangling with the old money Vale establishment.)\\n\\n(Interestingly, one of the insurance companies\\' public-facing lawyers arguing in 1991 that her clients had never abandoned the treasure nor their claims to it — Thompson\\'s side was arguing they *had* de facto abandoned it, making it up for grabs — was named… Mary**lyn** **Little**. [See: Lyn Corbray &amp; Littlefinger.] Is it possible GRRM read or saw her quoted on some TV news report about the affair, and thus that her name had some inspirational role? Doubtful, but tantalizing.)\\n\\nI think GRRM wrote Littlefinger (in part) with *both* parties to the conflict over the Ship of Gold in mind. The insurance companies were fighting for the rights of \"heirs\" using lawyerly \"piracy\" (piracy being synonomous with the ironborn), and Hoare-y Littlefinger sees himself as heir to multiple legacies and fights to regain them using similar pen-and-ink-and-bullshit. At the same time, Thompson was selling himself as the romantic figure Littlefinger longed to be as a child (when he played at being the Prince of Dragonflies) and more than a bit of a pirate himself (and that\\'s before more recent developments), and Littlefinger was written with him in mind, too.\\n\\nWhile Hoare-y Littlefinger adopts something like the legalistic tactics of the \"pirates in pinstripes\" denounced by the media, his story \"rhymes\" in a slew of way with that of the treasure-finder, Tommy Thompson, as it was told in the media at the time.\\n\\n##Abandoned Treasure, Abandoned Castle\\nThompson based his entire claim to the treasure on the fact that the insurance companies had demonstrably \"abandoned\" their claims to it. How does Littlefinger come to be Lord of Harrenhal, ancestral seat of House Hoare? Lady Whent abandoned it. (In multiple senses, actually.)\\n&gt;**Lady Whent** had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully, but she\\'d used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers, and **let the rest go to ruin. Now she was fled**… *(ACOK Arya VII)*\\n\\n\\n##Finders Keepers &amp; Squatter\\'s Rights\\nReporting on the court battle over Thompson\\'s find universally made reference to the principle of \"finders keepers\" following the initial lower court ruling in Thompson\\'s favor. \"Finders keepers\" seems in a way analogous to Littlefinger\\'s strategy vis-a-vis the Eyrie. He\\'s essentially trying to take it using something that\\'s not far removed from squatter\\'s rights: having gotten his toe in the door at the previous owner\\'s invitation, he subsequently refuses to leave. It\\'s very close to \"I found it, it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\n\\n##Not Without A Fight\\nWhere Thompson refused to give up the treasure he\\'d found to the insurance companies without a fight—\\n&gt;Thompson… wasn\\'t about to fling his hard-earned gold to the whims of the sea. He was going to fight. *(\"Tarnished Treasure\")*\\n\\n—Littlefinger found his \"treasure\", Cat—\\n&gt;There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me . . . but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. But she gave me something finer, a gift a woman can give but once. *(ASOS Sansa V)*\\n\\n—and refused to give her up to the scion of a much more powerful House without a fight. Nor, like Thompson in court, did he give up when hard-pressed by a seemingly superior, wealthy and powerful foe:\\n&gt;\"Yield!\" [Brandon] called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly. *(AGOT Catelyn VII)*\\n\\n##Battle Scars\\nLittlefinger was scarred in his fight with Brandon:\\n&gt;\"I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr\\'s life. He let him off with a scar.\" *-Catelyn (AGOT Catelyn IV)*\\n\\nThe lengthy, pirate-heavy, 1993 newspaper account of the story I\\'ve been quoting said this of Thompson:\\n&gt;As yet another court date approaches, Thompson admits to battle scars.\\n\\n(Given the way Thompson\\'s PR machine worked, it\\'s likely this was a narrative actively sold by Thompson, and thus something that may have been repeated in TV news and magazine show accounts and in other news and print magazine stories not easily accessible.)\\n\\n##Losing the Battle, Winning the War\\nLittlefinger lost his duel to Brandon, but (I believe) ultimately \"won the war\" by baiting Brandon into riding to his death in King\\'s Landing and by subsequently leveraging Lysa\\'s love into his current situation.\\n\\nThompson\\'s 1992 and 1993 legal \"losses\" to the insurance companies claiming the gold he found was theirs was analogous: While the Court of Appeals technically overruled a lower court and sided with the insurance companies, it also stipulated that Thompson\\'s group should still \"receive by far the largest share of the treasure\" and sent the case back for a lower court to determine the amount. In November 1993 an Admiralty court ruled that Thompson would get at least 90%. The ruling was upheld by the US Court of Appeals in June 1995 (long before GRRM finished writing *AGOT* in mid-1996) — one headline read \"Finders, (Mostly) Keepers\" — and the Supreme Court turned down a further appeal that October, definitively rendering the insurance companies\\' initial court victory pyrrhic and seemingly making Thompson, like Littlefinger, the ultimate winner.\\n\\n##Nerds vs. Cowboys, A Letter Writer vs. Knights\\nFrom early on the narrative sold to the world by Thompson using Ken Ringle of *The Washington Post* and the *Post\\'s* wire service—\\n&gt;Onto the scene… sailed… a low-profile shipload of computer-happy technocrats from Columbus, Ohio. In the ocean cowboy world of treasure hunters, their success story reads like the script for \"Revenge of the Nerds.\"\\n*([Washington Post - 9.14.1989 - \\'STORYBOOK TREASURE\\' FOUND OFF SOUTH CAROLINA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/14/storybook-treasure-found-off-south-carolina/e59459ac-31d6-4546-a482-18aaad62dafe/))*\\n\\n—is notably reminiscent of the story of Littlefinger transcending his provinical origins, his defeat by macho thug Brandon, and his exile to the Fingers at the hands of the knight and village-razer Hoster Tully to rise high using his wits in a world dominated by might and the sword.\\n\\n##Defiance, Ohio &amp; The Middle Finger\\nLittlefinger was of \"undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight\", \"a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets\" from a provincial backwater call \"The Fingers\". *(ACOK Tyrion IV; ASOS Sansa VI)* He\\'s from \"the the smallest of the Fingers\", which a look at the map suggests is in the same position as the middle finger (noting the \"thumb\" nub to the north) and which I suspect we\\'ll learn is *called* \"the Middle Finger\". Why? Because as we read in press accout after press account, Thompson, who couldn\\'t read until third grade, who flunked math and science tests in high school in high school, and who graduated from an unheralded midwestern state school where he was the only engineering student studying ocean engineering — i.e. who at least superficially had what we might call an \"undistinguished\" background before finding what was heralded as the greatest lost treasure ever — grew up in the tiny, rural backwater of *Defiance,* Ohio. Get it? Middle Finger. Defiance.\\n\\n(After first writing the foregoing paragraph a couple months ago, I realized that the \"Journeys\" map in the GRRM-approved *Lands of Ice &amp; Fire\" set confirms that the \"middle finger\" I suspected was Littlefinger\\'s *is* indeed where his tower is located.) \\n\\n(See also Littlefinger defying Brandon telling him to yield, defying the Vale lords, etc.)\\n\\n##Clever, Young, Creative Gold-Finders\\nEarly press accounts described Thompson in terms that are in many ways positively Littlefingerian: As a child, Thompson had been \"a precocious boy\". He built a working telephone when he was 8. *Life* began its profile of Thompson like this:\\n&gt;Tommy Thompson wasn\\'t like other boys growing up in Defiance, Ohio, in the 1960s. While his classmates were off slugging baseballs and imagining themselves to be Ted Williams [see: Brandon the \"jock\"], \"Tommy was always dragging home neighbors\\' junk from the alley — old TVs, radios, motors — and coming up with new inventions,\" remembers his sister Sandee Butterworth [shades of Butterwell, whose tourney in *The Mystery Knight* \"rhymes\" deeply with Littlefinger\\'s upcoming tourney at the Gates of the Moon]. But this wasn\\'t just another post-Sputnik nerd in the making.\\n\\nNow lauded by his investors as \"a great intellect\" and \"one of the smartest guys I ever met\", he was part of a group of \"young entrepreneurs\", and he and the team he put together showed \"creativity and entrepreneurship aplenty\" to \"far outrun\" older, competing salvage firms and find the lost Ship of God.\\n\\nAll that seems quite Littlefingerian:\\n&gt;\"I knew he would rise high,\" Catelyn said. \"He was always clever, even as a boy…\" *(AGOT Catelyn IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;[Lysa:] \"My father said he was too lowborn, but I knew how high he\\'d rise. Jon gave him the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when he increased the incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever he was and gave him other appointments, even brought him to King\\'s Landing to be master of coin.\" *(ASOS Sansa VI)*\\n***\\n&gt;[Littlefinger] moved his own men into place. … They were men of middling birth, by and large… but judging from their results, **far more able than their highborn predecessors.** *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n(Both Tullys speak of him \"rising high\". Obviously this foreshadows him taking over the Eyrie, per its height and the Arryns\\' words \"As High As Honor\", but \"rising high\" could also be seen as the inverse of *diving deep,* which Thompson had to do to find the wreck of the Ship of Gold on the deep sea floor, 8000 feet down.)\\n\\nBut the most obvious \"rhyme\" between Thompson and Littlefinger is that Thompson achieved fame because he found a bunch of gold. And Littlefinger? Same.\\n&gt;Littlefinger was… [a] clever… man, …always able to find[!] whatever gold the king or his Hand required… *(ACOK IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;\"The master of coin finds[!] the money.\" *-Littlefinger (AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n***\\n&gt;Littlefinger had been more use at court. He had a gift for finding[!] gold… *(AFFC Cersei IV)*\\n\\n\\n##Romantic Dreamers\\nThere was another angle to much of the coverage of Thompson, though. In addition to being a *clever* child, he was portrayed as a *dreamer*. The next sentence of above-quoted *Life* magazine profile pivoted from his childhood capacity for invention to his childhood imagination:\\n&gt;Though land-locked, Tommy and his buddy Barry Schatz often dreamed together about sea adventures, about the mysteries of what might be found on the floor of the ocean.\\n\\nA 1993 piece painted Thompson\\'s desire to *get fucking rich* as product of a boyhood \"love of the sea\" that included visions of \"scouring sunken ships\" for \"aging artifacts . . . perhaps even treasure\".\\n\\nThis compares to Littlefinger playing at the Prince of Dragonflies:\\n&gt;\"We\\'re all just songs in the end. If we are lucky.\" She had played at being Jenny that day, had even wound flowers in her hair. And Petyr had pretended to be her Prince of Dragonflies. Catelyn could not have been more than twelve, Petyr just a boy. *(ASOS Catelyn V)*\\n\\n\\n##Littlefinger &amp; Thompson Do P.R.\\nIn fact, Thompson waged a massively successful, \"carefully crafted high-profile media campaign\" to plant stories like this and garner coverage that painted him as a romantic hero fighting for the little guy. As *Forbes* put it much later:\\n&gt;Thompson always controlled the information flow. *([Forbes \"Ship of Fools\"](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0619/158.html?sh=40a6fd417dd9))*\\n\\nConsider in this regard Thompson\\'s quote in the wake of the US Court of Appeals decision finding for the insurance companies:\\n&gt;\"Only through our efforts has the lost legend of the S.S. Central America been rediscovered, the treasure-hunting group\\'s founder, Thomas G. Thompson, said in a statement. \"It saddens me to think it could be possible that a group of the largest insurance companies in the world could be awarded the treasure we worked so hard to find and recover.\" *(https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/28/us/insurers-to-share-shipwreck-s-gold.html)*\\n\\nLittlefinger is a little guy who plays at the romantic idea of being the Prince of Dragonflies and who jokes about cultivating a dastardly image while being a romantic using language reminiscent of Thompson\\'s, above:\\n&gt;Petyr Baelish smiled. \"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and **I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.**\" *(AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n\\nBut Littlefinger is acutely aware of the importance of public perception as Thompson was when he waged his successful PR campaign to paint his salvage mission as the fulfillment of romantic childhood dreams and fantasies about \"scouring sunken ships\" for \"aging artifacts . . . perhaps even treasure\". To wit, recall that he advises Cersei to launch what is in effect a P.R./media campaign regarding the rumors of her incest:\\n&gt;Petyr Baelish steepled his fingers. \"If we attempt to silence this talk, we only lend it credence. Better to treat it with contempt, like the pathetic lie it is. And meantime, fight fire with fire. … A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. … [If] we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold, well . . . the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon.\" *(ACOK Tyrion III)*\\n\\n##Littlefinger &amp; Thompson: Master Jugglers. (Also: Swan? *Again?*)\\nIn one anecdote, Thompson talks about how as a kid he built a lawn mower with four engines that pulled \"three rotary mowers\":\\n\"The problem was keeping all four engines running at once.\" [said Thompson] *(https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2014/10/21/treasure-hunt-on-high-seas/9315335007/)*\\n\\nKeeping a bunch of engines driving whirling blades all running at once? I can\\'t help but think of this:\\n&gt;A master juggler was Petyr Baelish. *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n—coupled with this:\\n&gt;A juggler kept a half-dozen swords and axes whirling through the air as skewers of blood sausage were brought sizzling to the tables, a juxtaposition that Tyrion thought passing clever, though not perhaps in the best of taste. *(ASOS Tyrion VIII)*\\n\\nEspecially because of the lines *immediately* preceding that last Tyrion quote:\\n&gt;\"Then came some strolling pipers and clever dogs and sword swallowers, with buttered pease, chopped nuts, and slivers of swan poached in a sauce of saffron and peaches. (**\"Not swan again,\"** Tyrion muttered, remembering his supper with his sister on the eve of battle.) *(ASOS Tyrion VIII)*\\n\\nWhy is Tyrion expressing that he\\'s sick of eating swan interesting to me? Because one of the Thompson\\'s other favorite PR-tested anecdotes was to talk about one of the hardships he\\'d endured while looking for the Ship of Gold: at one point having to eat fried chicken for every single meal for weeks on end. \"Not chicken again\" could\\'ve been his motto.\\n\\n\\n##Tinkerer &amp; Tinkers\\nAnother big PR talking point (we can infer) was that Thompson had always been a \"**tinkerer**\". A single 1989 profile quoted him as saying \"I was always a tinkerer\", talked about the remaining gold waiting for him \"to come back and start tinkering again\", and finally referred to him as \"the inveterate tinkerer\".\\n\\nThere\\'s only *one* use of anything like that term in the *ASOIAF* canon, and it\\'s smack in the middle of a passage—\\n&gt;In Volantis **he had seen the galleys taking on provisions. The whole city had seemed drunk. Sailors and soldiers and tinkers[!] had been observed dancing in the streets with nobles and fat merchants, and in every inn and winesink cups were being raised** to the new triarchs. **All the talk had been of the gold and gems** and slaves **that would flood into Volantis** once the dragon queen was dead. One day of such reports was all that Victarion Greyjoy could stomach; **he paid the gold price** for food and water, though it shamed him, and took his ships back out to sea. *(ADWD The Iron Suitor)*\\n\\n—that describes a scene suspiciously akin to the celebration when Thompson\\'s salvage ship returned to port with the first load of gold from the Ship of Gold, as reported in that same magazine profile on Thompson that called him a tinkerer three times and also by *The Washington Post*.\\n\\nThe \"nobles and fat merchants\" who seemed drunk and who were \"dancing in the streets\" seem like a riff on the \"cheering crowd of [Thompson\\'s] financial backers\" who were there waiting for him when his crew returned to port in 1989 — \"some of Central Ohio\\'s wealthiest citizens gathered to clap their hands\".\\n\\nWhere Victarion thinks \"the whole city… seemed drunk\", it seems like \"the whole city\" of Norfolk turned out to greet Thompson and company: we read about a \"cheering crowd\", a \"brass-band welcome\" from a local high school band, police, federal marshals, and a media circus. The *WaPo* article includes an anecdote which seems like grist for GRRM\\'s description of Volantis:\\n&gt;Genevieve Gross of North Olmsted, Ohio, the great-great-niece of Alvin Ellis, one of the 423 passengers lost on the *Central America,* **thanked the city of Norfolk for its kindness** to Ellis\\'s widow when she was put ashore here with other survivors without a penny to her name. **The city showered her with food and clothing, Gross said, the hotel where she landed waived her bill, and the innkeeper presented her with more than $700 in gold to help her when she left.**\\n\\nIt\\'s almost as if \"the whole city had [*been*] drunk\".\\n\\n*Immediately* before Victarion describes Volantis, drunk on talk of the gold that would soon \"flood into\" town (an approriate term if this is indeed a wink at the Ship of Gold coverage!), he declares in response to Wulfe\\'s proposal that \"another day [delay] might mean more another ship\" to add to the fleet:\\n&gt;\"Aye. And ten days might mean ten ships, or none at all. We have squandered too many days waiting on the sight of sails. Our victory will be that much the sweeter if we win it with a smaller fleet.\"\\n\\nIt just so happens that the *WaPo* piece about the cheering welcome party for Thompson talks of a similar number of days \"squandered\":\\n&gt;**The group lost more than a week** of operational work to Hurricane Hugo…\\n\\nAnd Victarion\\'s logic (a \"sweeter\" victory \"with a smaller fleet\") mirrors that of Thompson, who did what he did as a small, upstart firm, outracing other, far larger, established salvage firms to find the *Central America* with his single ship.\\n\\nAll that, right in the one and only spot where GRRM uses \"tinker\" — a key motif in Thompson\\'s carefully crafted, PR-deployed myth-making.\\n\\n\\n##Low-Profile Whiz Kids!\\nThe lede of *The Washington Post\\'s* PR-engineered July 18, 1987 story breaking the news of the find (\"TREASURE HUNTERS CLAIM $450 MILLION SHPWRECK\") spoke in breathless terms about the nous of Thompson\\'s team:\\n&gt;A partnership of low-profile treasure hunters, operating on the outer edge of ocean engineering technology, has laid claim to what it believes to be one of America\\'s most historic shipwrecks, a paddle-wheel steamer sunk in 1857 with some $450 million in gold coins from the California Gold Rush.\\n\\nAgain there\\'s an echo of Littlefinger\\'s supposed brilliance here. \"The outer edge of ocean engineering technology!\" Golly, it\\'s practically magic!\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the \"low-profile\" bit. In a lot of ways this recalls Tyrion\\'s description of Littlefinger skating by, under everybody\\'s radar:\\n&gt;No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone\\'s friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage. *(ACOK Tyrion IV)*\\n\\n##Mud\\nThe same article described the location in which the Ship of Gold was found as \"a vast, virtually featureless undersea mud flat\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth nothing that Littlefinger has a curious association with mud:\\n&gt;[Catelyn] remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\\'d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. *(AGOT Catelyn V)*\\n\\nCould that be a wink? It certainly seems like a metaphor for Littlefinger\\'s greed, which would fit.\\n\\n##Star Trek! The Wizard of Oz! \\nWhen the same *WaPo* shill/reporter wrote another feature on September 14, 1989 after being granted exclusive access to Thompson\\'s salvage ship when it began recovery operations, the language was exactly the kind of stuff that would attract a nerd like GRRM\\'s attention. I already quoted the \"Revenge of the Nerds\" language. There\\'s also a *Star Trek* reference:\\n&gt;It is driven from a control room in the bowels of this vessel, which, with its blinking monitors, glowing dials and multiple computer keyboards, could double for the cockpit of the starship Enterprise. \\n\\n(The 1992 *Life* story doubles up on the Star Trek bit, making me think this was another heavily manufactured angle. Thompson\\'s ship is said to have \"workmanlike gray decks\" but \"Stark Trek guts\" containing \"a wondrous world of technology\".)\\n\\nWe get a fantastic image of \"a mechanical Victorian dowager at underwater tea\", and a Wizard of Oz reference—\\n&gt;Working in a lightly silted area of the wreck they hadn\\'t touched before, they used Nemo\\'s water thrusters to blow away the underwater dust and suddenly saw what some aboard are already calling \"the yellow brick road.\"\\n\\n—which prefigures *ASOIAF* referencing the Wicked Witch of the West/East when \"Lady Olenna\\'s nasty little smile\" reminds Cersei of wicked witchy Maggi (from the Westerlands via Essos) while reminding *us* of a guy with an Olenna-esque \"nasty grin\" saying, improbably, \"my pretties\":\\n&gt;The third was armed only with a nasty grin. \"And where are you lot bound, my pretties?\" he asked. *(TWOW Arianne II)*\\n\\nAll that language could have sucked GRRM in.\\n\\n##\"Storybook Treasure In A Kid\\'s Book\"\\nThe most obvious GRRM-bait and *ASOIAF* tie-in, though, is the story\\'s headline — \\'STORYBOOK TREASURE\\' FOUND OFF SOUTH CAROLINA — and Thompson being quoted saying:\\n&gt;It\\'s just like a storybook treasure in a kid\\'s book.\\n\\nThis was a practiced line. The 1992 *Life* feature seemingly quotes Thompson\\'s apparently contemporanous description/log as the treasure was first being revealed by undersea camera like this:\\n&gt;The *Central America* looks truly like a storybook treasure.\\n\\nIf \"storybook treasure in a kid\\'s book\" doesn\\'t raise hackles I don\\'t know what would. Storybook stories a.k.a. \"songs\" are a constant touchstone in *ASOIAF*. *ASOAIF\\'s* constant theme that real life is not a story—\\n&gt;The fat leather-bound volume was full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. Children\\'s stories, if truth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history. *(ASOS Daenerys VI)*\\n\\n—is famously exemplified by none other than Littlefinger:\\n&gt;\"Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\" *(AGOT Sansa III)*\\n\\nIndeed, Littlefinger\\'s lesson seems drawn straight out of the reporting on the Ship of Gold as it stood when GRRM went to write *AGOT*: The vaunted \"storybook treasure\" Thompson had found via much ballyhooed technological brilliance and claimed in the 1989 *Post* article could be worth \"$1 billion\" was reported in universal coverage of a key court ruling c. November 1993 to be worth only $21 million — almost $10 million less than the $30 million the same court ruling said had been spent to recover it.\\n\\nThus the finding and recovery of the \"storybook treasure\" looked, in the years *AGOT* was being written, to be a boondoggle.\\n\\nI think GRRM almost \"confirms\" that the Ship of Gold affair (as it stood c. 1995) inspired him via Jon\\'s story in *AGOT*. Jon gets to the Wall and is told that life there isn\\'t like \"the stories your wet nurse told you\" (i.e. stories \"in a kid\\'s book\", in Thompson\\'s words):\\n&gt;\"Cold and hard and mean, that\\'s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse.\" *-Donal Noye (AGOT Jon III)*\\n\\nAnd then, before *AGOT* is through, he learns, of all things, that \"digging for buried treasure\" (a la Thompson\\'s search for sunken treasure) refers not to a child\\'s romantic notion of an adventure but rather to the sordid fact of fucking \"whores\" in a hole in the ground:\\n&gt;On the Wall, he\\'d heard men call the whores \"buried treasures.\" He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. *(AGOT Jon IX)*\\n***\\n&gt;\"You know where I\\'d be if it was me? I\\'d be in Mole\\'s Town, digging for buried treasure.\" Toad\\'s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon\\'s mare snorted. *(AGOT Jon IX)*\\n\\nOf course, the fact that \"whores\" and thus Hoares have just been conflated with buried treasure rather tends to support the idea that the Hoare sigil\\'s gold ship is indeed a reference to the sunken treasure of the Ship of Gold.\\n\\n##The Smell of Bullshit Begins\\nBacking up, on October 6 1989, the *WaPo* ran a follow-up piece on the return of Thompson\\'s salvage ship to port in Norfolk called \"TREASURE HUNTERS\\' GOLDEN MOMENT\", covering the massive press events Thompson\\'s PR people organized. It\\'s easy to read it and see how GRRM may have begun to view the supposed heroes of a children\\'s story come to life as possibly at least slightly full of shit. (A la Littlefinger.)\\n\\nThis gem comes near the beginning:\\n&gt;Citing scientific and technological byproducts of the group\\'s successful search for the U.S. Mail Ship Central America and its cargo from the California gold rush, Thompson told a cheering crowd of his financial backers that **\"we learned there are many kinds of treasure, and that\\'s the best discovery of all.\"**\\n\\nIt\\'s *possible* that Thompson\\'s unbelievebly cheesy, afterschool special-assed quote — was he *really* talking about \"scientific… byproducts\" or was he talking about \"the real treasure being the friends we made along the way\"? — *didn\\'t* inspire GRRM to write the following exchange in which Littlefinger basically mocks such schlocky notions of \"treaure\":\\n&gt;Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, **\"You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.\"**\\n\\n&gt;**\"Oh, now there\\'s a treasure,\" Littlefinger said**, exiting. *(AGOT Eddard IV)*\\n\\nBut I wouldn\\'t bet on it. If GRRM read this shit or watched TV coverage, he would\\'ve seen right through Thompson\\'s claims to altruism. *Obviously* the \"best discovery of all\" was the *literal fucking treasure*, not whatever high-minded crap they were trying to peddle to seem like they weren\\'t motivated by greed. (And *oh my god* was a skeptical outlook vindicted in the coming decades. But that\\'s another story.)\\n\\nMaybe Thompson\\'s line about other kinds of treasure didn\\'t inspire GRRM to have (ironborn, possible Hoare) Mance say this—\\n&gt;\"And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that **her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me.**\" *(ASOS Jon I)*\\n\\n—and, having thus equated a \"gift\" from a woman with \"treasure\", to have our boy Littlefinger talk about the another \"kind of treasure\" that he clearly *does* relish:\\n&gt;\"There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me . . . but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. But she gave me something finer, **a gift a woman can give but once.** How could I turn my back upon her daughter? *(ASOS Sansa V)*\\n\\nBut it could have. Especially in conjunction with e.g. the 1992 *Life* \"story\"/P.R.-release, which was literally called \"The Greatest Treasure Ever Found\".\\n\\n(Notice what Littlefinger is doing in that passage. He is almost certainly *bullshitting* the hell out of Sansa. He wants to *use* Sansa, and he wants to fuck her. He\\'s like Thompson, talking about how great the scientific advancements are and acting like the story isn\\'t that he maybe just made a billion dollars.)\\n\\nThe article closes with more saccharine schmaltz from one of Thompson\\'s junior partners… and Thompson doing something very, very familiar to *ASOIAF* readers:\\n&gt;**Thompson stroked his curly beard, grinned and mused in his laconic fashion: \"We hope to be rich.\"** Evans, however, said it wasn\\'t that simple. \"There are so many things of value produced by an expedition like this,\" the historian said. \"To me it\\'s become a kind of celebration of American ideals -- free enterprise, hard work and the exploration of a frontier. **\"And in that way,\" he said with a smile, \"we\\'re already rich.\"**\\n\\n***\\n##CONTINUED IN OLDEST REPLY',\n",

Are Razer Membrane Switches good for gaming?\\n4. Are Razer Membrane Switches noisy? what is the key feel? is it comfortable to write with?\\n\\n***Very important note. Please don't recommend me another brand, or another razer mechanical keyboard.*** ***~~I am kinda broke~~*** ***so my budget is exactly for Ornata or Cynosa.***\",\n",

       "  'body': 'It is a weird way for them to measure it to be sure. I did read what they were trying to say and how they measure it. \"Factors affecting Latency: Scan Rate, Polling Rate, Response Time, Connection Type\" this part to be specific on the last site. It boggles me that they went to the length of effort on making and explaining that site but make no mention of the inherent variance of the keystroke. Surely they must have noticed that they can have a natural variance of 30-300ms on a keyboard? At that point any actual difference from the latency that there may or may not be between two products is completely lost in the noise.\\n\\nOn my G815 the press triggers instantly when the key starts to go down and I got quite a light touch and don\\'t really push it too aggressively resulting in huge delay according to that site (since it starts the timer when the press triggers but ends the timer when it bottoms out, eh why?). On one of the rubberdomes I tried I got consistently low times and I feel like it liked that one since it registers the start of the stroke later and almost at the same time as the end of the stroke. Subjectively I feel that that keyboard is my least responsive to type or to play on. I also tried a long press distance mechanical keyboard and got average results with it.\\n\\nTo sum it up G815 with short actuation mechanical the average was extremely high 180ms. Long actuation but low resistance mechanical K65 about 80ms (I feel like it liked this one since it doesn\\'t trigger the stroke immediately but rather lets me pick a bit of speed first, It\\'s not as snappy a keyboard as the G815 but oh well.) And the king of the hill was the K120 that I got as a travel / backup keyboard, that one is a blazing fast 30ms area (not bad for 10 euro keyboard hehe). The test really got the opposite result of the \"speed\" of the keyboards that I would rank them at. I can\\'t help but feel that it is comparing apples and oranges. A fun little exercise though :)',\n",

       "  'body': \"So I made a first draft of the build, let me know if you want to change any stuff or not. Added peripherals as well and made it to perform better than a 3060! The performance of the 6700xt is between a 3060 ti and 3070 in performance, sometimes outperforming the 3070 is some games because of more vram and optimization.\\n\\n[Klik hier om de onderdelen te zien (megekko winkelmand).](https://www.megekko.nl/wl/2QYEJ3AZ)\\n\\nSo the price of the pc build is €1300, far under your budget. This build is mostly meant for a 1080p monitor, but 1440p is easily possible. \\n\\nYou do have 1tb of fast 4.0 nvme storage, 32gb of white rgb ram, i5 13500, rx 6700xt, an aio (just went for it with argb fans in the front as well, can be changed) and actually a case I love so much.\\n\\nThe case has these flowers on the front panel, glass panel and I think on the back as well, but not overdone. I think it's actually such a cool edition, here is [a build done in it.](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0m8vDZvUQzxveV7aM48ZMLEKFVm9EkN6a4Vf7xkpyn3u3BfAjUWbgH4aMGYxf5VQcl&amp;id=278659922159897)\\n\\nSo for the peripherals:\\n\\n\\n1)Keyboard: I'm actually someone who loves custom keyboards, so if you want to do that let me know. There is a perfect prebuilt tho which I think you'll love and I am so digging those keycaps, it's the Akko Tokyo series.\\n[60% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-3061s-rgb)\\n[65% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-3068b-plus-mechanical-keyboard)\\n[75% version](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-3084b-plus-mechanical-keyboard?_pos=9&amp;_sid=1e02cbe8d&amp;_ss=r)\\n\\n\\n2) Deskmat: With a nice keyboard you need a nice deskmat. So of course from Akko the Tokyo deskmat would fit so well and looks so god dam good, but if you don't like it I'll be adding a site where I personally always get my deskmats.\\n[Tokyo Deskmat](https://akkogear.de/products/world-tour-tokyo-r2-mouse-pad?_pos=4&amp;_sid=1e02cbe8d&amp;_ss=r)\\n[Mykeyboard.eu in-stock deskmats](https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/category/accessories/desk-mat_71/?selected_facets=num_in_stock_exact%3A%5B1+TO+%2A%5D)\\n\\n\\n3) Mouse, I mean I'll just recommend pulsar. Fast and light mouses, great to use. They have a lot of versions, but first you have to know your mouse grip. [Check here what your mousegrip is.](https://voltcave.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mouse-grip-styles.jpg)\\n\\nBased on the grip choose between these mice:\\nPalm grip: Xlite V2\\nPalm grip with small hands or claw grip: Xlite v2 mini\\nFingertip grip or relaxed claw with small hands: X2 mini\\nRelaxed claw grip: X2\\n\\n\\n4) Monitor, I mean I chose [this](https://www.megekko.nl/product/2077/921387/Monitoren/Lenovo-G24-20-24-165Hz-IPS-gaming-monitor). It's cheap for what you get, 165hz and a nice IPS panel. Works great for the pc.\\n\\n5) Headphones. Pretty important. If you want good audio quality I would recommend getting studio headphones with a seperate microphone. You can have closed back and open back headphones, closed back gives a more noise control effect and has a deeper bass whereas open back has an overall more clear sound and leaks audio out of the headphones. I personally prefer open back, but yeah preference.\\n[Open back](https://www.amazon.nl/HIFIMAN-Magnetische-Hoofdtelefoon-Audiofielen-Gevoeligheid/dp/B08ZJM3N22/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?)\\n[Closed back](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07T5V699K/ref=asc_df_B07T5V699K1682735280000/)\\n\\nDo note that for the he400se, the sound will actually improve a lot if you use an [dac](https://www.wifimedia.eu/nl/ifi-audio-zen-air-dac.html?). \\n\\n7) Microphone, the [mpm1000u](https://www.amazon.nl/Marantz-Professional-MPM1000-Grootmembraan-Studio-Opname/dp/B01C05AL4C/ref=asc_df_B01C05AL4C/?) is great. Adding a boom arm is recommended, but up to you :)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, want different parts or anything else let me know! If you would like an ultrawide monitor for example or a 1440p monitor, we'll have to change that and change the build a bit to make it better for this higher resolution. The case airflow isn't great, but with these parts it'll be good enough.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Of course! [I own one](https://i.imgur.com/ilkRg3z.jpg), though it\\'s actually my second Nakaya. My point is it isn\\'t constructive to compare how much you *could* spend in two hobbies, because the answer for both is always essentially infinite.\\n\\nA more useful metric is how most people experience the hobby. That requires two points: what\\'s the cheapest you can \"get in to the hobby for\" (spend at least enough to get some idea of what the hobby is about and why people like it/might go deeper), and what\\'s the point at which you *can* spend more, but you won\\'t get any objectively better features.\\n\\nMost Nakayas are around $700~800. Of course there are the raden and maki-e models which scale well in to five figures... but those are art pieces. Can you really argue someone shopping for a TWSBI would get more for their money if they bought a $30,000 Nakaya? I could also commission a solid brass Austin or custom Keycult and then pay for it to be hand scrolled. That would probably be north of 10k but not enough people \"experience the hobby\" like that to make it worthwhile to discuss.\\n\\nFountain pens probably have a longer \"tail\" to be sure - they turn in to art pieces more than pens in the low thousands. Even Montblanc\\'s writer editions and great character editions fall in to this IMO, as do Pelikan\\'s limited edition Souveran pens.\\n\\nI can give someone a Platinum Preppy and an ink cartridge and they can get what the hobby is about for around $5. I can hand someone a Red Dragon mechanical and they can get what the hobby is about (at least a little bit), but the cheapest I see for those is around $35. I can see the case for something like a TWSBI Eco or Lamy Safari and a bottle of ink ($40~50) being \"the entry point\", but I\\'d actually argue that\\'s more where most people in the hobby reside and would be more akin to a Keychron Q1 or GMMK Pro build ($250 or so, once you account for switches &amp; caps). This is at a point where you\\'re deeper in to \"getting it\" so I don\\'t think a prebuilt makes sense from the keyboard side anymore.\\n\\nI would say you keep getting \"more from your money\" in the fountain pen space up until $200 or so. You can use a Pilot Custom as the example instead of the Lamy, it doesn\\'t really matter. Throw enough ink to last *years* in and some nice paper or a very nice bound book and you\\'re at maybe $300. Once you have a gold nib, solidly built pen from a well respected manufacturer, spending more stops buying you features. The equivalent in the keyboard space might be something like the QK75, plus keycaps from a real manufacturer instead of clones, and maybe some nicer switches like Oil Kings, Box Jades, or Boba U4Ts. Now that\\'s a $500 keyboard compared against a $200 pen.\\n\\nSo at the cheapest possible entry point we have about $5 vs. $35\\n\\nIn the low end we have $45 vs. $250\\n\\nAnd the point where our money stops objectively going way further we have $300 vs. $500\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I\\'d say that\\'s how most people \"experience\" the hobby, and why fountain pens are objectively noticeably cheaper.\\n\\nI\\'ve got Watermans, Pelikans, Montblancs, a Conid, a Nakaya, a handful of TWSBIs, a handful of Lamys, enough ink to last a lifetime. Ten years of buying pens and the average pen cost is probably around $300. Five years in keyboards, only one or two of which are arguably high end (Akko MOD 007, KBD67 Lite, NK87 alu, Metakey Tenet brass, Driftmechanics Forever65, Driftmechanics Austin, plus all the switches and caps I\\'ve bought), my average is pushing $700 per build.',\n",

       "  'body': ' Hello everyone, recently I decided to buy a Keychron Q6 (yes, size does matter to some). I\\'ve been using more or less everything in the past, from classic IBM keyboards with a DIN plug to fancy (and easily borked) Logitech peripherals. Now after my most recent G915 borked out I decided to go back to the type of keyboard I tend to love most, a nice mechanical one, partially since I had fond memories of my now ancient DAS Ultimate and the IBM\\'s of ancient history. Now.. here\\'s the thing.. I\\'ve been reading way too much on these forums which results in a severe case of FOMOM, fear of missing out mods, so... I\\'m looking for advice. The Keychron I bought came with \"OSA\" caps, a profile I didn\\'t expect to love, but well.. shoot me, I like the form and feel. I don\\'t however like the colors and the spacebar kind of makes a racket, so.. any tips for me? I\\'m looking for a combo keycap set that\\'s olive green + grey, doesn\\'t come with a 2 year wait, bonus points if it allows for backlight to shine through (no I don\\'t need the backlight, but it\\'s nice to have) and more than that, something with a spacebar that tocks instead of pings, tips that include a combo of two sets are perfectly fine as well. the profile I prefer is similar in height to the custom OSA of Keychron but the shape isn\\'t that important I guess. (Yes, you\\'re also allowed to tell me to go hunt unicorns instead, I get it). Any tips on better switches are also welcome, currently using the default Gateron linears that came with it, I prefer clicky, but.. these days there\\'s a baby asleep in the room next to me, so linear it is :P',\n",

       "  'body': \"Full size keyboard are becoming more common in the custom enthusiast space. It all started because a lot of people didn't need everything on a full size 104 key keyboard and sought to simplify things. Companies like IBM made the Space Saver Keyboard (SSK) versions of the Model M, but there weren't many in the early 2000s. Bringing back the TKL was first and it's gotten smaller since. Many find the benefits of a smaller main keyboard with a separate numpad to be the sweet spot in terms of usability.\\n\\nAs for media keys, which seems to be a major point for you, almost every enthusiast keyboard uses a form of re-programmable firmware. Most of them are QMK based, with compatibility for VIA/VIAL graphic interfaces, others use TMK or others depending on features and components used. This re-programmable firmware allows easy remapping of keys to be whatever you want. Different function layers for alternative layouts, use of omitted physical keys like F keys and nav keys on a 60/65%. You can program play/pause/skip/etc. wherever you want. The benefit of this is that the keyboard map is stored on the physical board and not in the software on your computer. Macros are also very easy to accomplish using these firmwares.\\n\\nI would say in the last five years or so, the emphasis in the custom keyboard space has been on sound and aesthetics. This can be seen in the sheer number of themed keycap group buys. That's not personally my cup of tea, I far prefer tasteful color accents and neutral tones.\\n\\nPrebuilts from gaming companies and the major computer manufacturers sometimes add dedicated media keys to help differentiate their product and sell more. But Corsair charging $200 plus for their shitty mechanical keyboards is asinine. There is little value in it, and aesthetic customization is often limited because they use non-standard keycap sizes.\\n\\nIf you want an inexpensive full-size keyboard, I'd recommend Keychron's Pro series K boards. They use a plastic chassis but have QMK/VIA compatibility, hotswap sockets for changing switches to your liking, and standard keycap sizes. You could get the K10 Pro with switches and a cheap keycap set to match your preferences for less than a Corsair K100.\\n\\nIf you want a nicer machined aluminum case, the Keychron Q6 is there for you. If you don't need the navigation cluster as much (or don't mind accessing it on a different layer) the Q5 is a compact fullsize layout called the 1800 layout.\",\n",

But the keycaps are a pretty big miss. I was wondering if these knock off gmk 9009 keycaps would fit this keyboard. Also, does anyone know if that knob can be replaced  LMAO\\n\\nIf not, any recommendations? I’m thinking $150 at most.\\n\\nThanks in advance.',\n",

[Colorful keyboards](https://igearworld.com/product/keybee/) are smaller and may not contain a number pad or other keys, whereas full-size keyboards feature all the keys, including a number pad. When choosing a size, take into account your particular preferences and work space.  \\n**Backlighting**: Think about a keyboard with LED backlighting if you want to use your keyboard in low light or just enjoy the way it looks. Even customized lighting effects are available on certain keyboards.  \\n**Connectivity**: Keyboards can be connected to your computer using Bluetooth, USB, or other wireless protocols. Think about your configuration and if a wired or wireless connection is best for you.  \\n**Price**: Keyboards can cost anything from $20 and several hundred dollars. Choosing a keyboard should take your budget into account.  \\n**Here are some prominent keyboard alternatives to keep in mind**:  \\n**Logitech K810**: This wireless keyboard is a fantastic choice for typing in dim light because it is small and illuminated.  \\n**iGear**: This mechanical wireless keyboard has adjustable illumination and a sturdy design.

       "  'selftext': '**Genre: Industrial Metal/Groove Metal**\\n\\n**Release Date: 16th June 1995**\\n\\n**Streaming:**\\n\\n* [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/demanufacture-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/1565825965)\\n* [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/65GdWk0paVbY04benEKKIU?autoplay=true)\\n* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/vL4deQWh1mc)\\n\\n**Review: (**[**Ghostcultmag**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/) **-** [**Keefy**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/author/keefyadmin/)**)** \\n\\nMany times in music journalism, we writers are given to hyperbole, often because it is the low hanging fruit of the field to gush about the classics with a torrent of compliments. You often read words like *genre-defying,* and frankly, a lot of the time they don’t land as they are meant to. However, in the case of the entire career of **Fear Factory** and certainty of the album *Demanufacture* (**Roadrunner Records**), the words can never do proper justice to the music. Simply stated, *Deamnfacture* is one of the most important, unique, and unapologetically brutal albums in heavy metal history.\\n\\nFear Factory was already ahead of its time with its legendary demo, produced by **Ross Robinson**, their debut *Soul of A New Machine*, and their inventive remix album *Fear is the Mindkiller* (both Roadrunner). So clearly they were building up to something grandiose for their pivotal third release. How much of game-changer this album would have been tough to predict at the time, but after its release would go on to be impossible to deny.\\n\\nWe could write this entire retrospective about the title track ‘Demanufacture’ alone. Everything about the song was next level big. The one of a kind right-hand chugs, the uncanny riffs, powerful and technical drumming, and **Burton C. Bell’s** unique vocals, fully come into his own just in the first few minutes of the song. It is as good an opening track on any album in the entire decade of the 1990s. The track clearly set the template that not only was this a vastly improved effort for the band, you were hearing something truly brand new and life-affirming. A sound that could change your very DNA, and would impact how metal was created and recorded afterward.\\n\\nThe album continues going from strength to strength, as complex riffs, inventive melodies, and brutal parts just smash your earpiece. And the hooks! Even the heaviest songs on *Demanufacture* have amazing hooks and memorable, sing-a-long parts. You can’t really even say that about the majority of extreme metal, which is why the band’s popularity exploded.\\n\\nSongs like Self ‘Bias Resistor’ and ‘Zero Signal’ we just thick with drama and intensity. The terrific extra-musical parts from sequencers, and keyboards, movie sound effects, and other ear candy owed as much to the suffocating Orwellian dystopia of movies like *Blade Runne*r (a prior influence) and [***The Terminator***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpMg1upld0w) franchise, in which the band clearly interpolated both musically and aesthetically. Frequent collaborator Rhys Fulber (F**ront Line Assembly**) and **Reynor Diego** added a lot of the synths and practical samples, along with Bell. The man versus machine battle played out over eleven tracks is brilliant and foreshadowed our current society in a prescient way. In [**Ghost Cult’s 2016 interview**](https://www.ghostcultmag.com/interview-dino-cazares-of-fear-factory-the-future-is-here/) with **Dino Cazares**, he laid out his vision for what they were going for conceptually: \\n\\n“***On this record, what we wanted to talk about was not the man versus the machine but the man and the machine becoming one. The singularity process would actually be where man and machine have become one. In other words, they are able to create a cell – a little mechanical cell that they could inject into your body…like certain diseases that you have in your body, like cancer cells or obviously nano-technology. So once they perfect that…what’s next? Man and machine becoming one, and that’s what we’re talking*** ***about on this one.”***\\n\\n“***Actually even when you’ve got people like Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Hawking talking about the singularity process, they’ll also try to stop it, which is kind of ironic.”***\\n\\n***“Remember the whole cloning wars when everybody was cloning sheep and dogs? They put a law that you couldn’t do that. Obviously you’re going to be able to clone a human. You pretty much can already, but there’s a law against it. That’s pretty much what they think that is going to happen in the near future where they’re going to put a law against technology and humans becoming one.”*** \\n\\nArguably the bands’ best known and best overall track ‘Replica,’ was a minor hit on metal radio, the video was in rotation at **MTV’s Headbangers Ball,** and the song became a trademark for the band. Bell was never more heartfelt, impactful, or dynamic in his delivery and the track is just bliss to all headbangers. Bell’s vocal style and his deft ability to swap back and forth between melody and guttural vocals grew a wave of imitators, that ven found its way into mainstream metalcore and rock decades later.\\n\\nNormally most bands have a top-heavy album that falls off in the middle, but not **FF.** ‘New Breed’ is almost a thrash death metal mash-up with a hypnotic beat that just sucks you in. Next up, their cover of **Head of David’s** ‘Dog Day Sunrise’ is a fan favorite, and owes a lot to their kinship with all of **Godflesh** and (HoD)’s **Justin Broadrick** musically and as genre leaders.\\n\\n‘Body Hammer’ almost has a New York Hardcore riff to it, and maybe it’s just me, but the machine sounds during the song my have influenced the MCU’s *Iron Man* movie when Tony Stark makes the first suit in a cave and [**hammers the metal parts into shape**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHU49CD0TOs). Another great song. ‘Flashpoint’ is short and has a very 1980s proto-industrial metal *Musiq-concrete* style that I like. ‘Pisschrist’ is another deep cut that could have been the best song on any other album and a personal favorite of mine to this day.\\n\\nWith the epic closing track ‘A Therapy For Pain’ the band displayed their full vision, changing what was possible for many bands making heavy music. The set the standard and would be not only an influence on progressive metal and death metal bands in that decade such as **Meshuggah** and **Mnemic**, but they would also shape several subgenres such as melodic death metal (**At The Gates**, early **Soilwork**), **Static-X** and more commercial industrial bands) as well. They birthed a vision uncluttered and sleek, ready to be spoon-fed into our frontal lobes. Not even the biggest bands of the decade like **Metallica, Pantera, Slipknot,** and **Type O Negative**, all with multiple major releases in the genre could overshadow the greatness of this album. It was definitely a combined team effort from the band, and without a doubt in the pantheon of greatest albums ever. And that is no exaggeration at all. \\n\\n**Discussion Ideas:**\\n\\n* Praise?\\n* Criticisms?\\n* Personal experiences\\n* Best/Worst tracks?\\n* Has the album impacted the Metal scene?\\n* How has the artist evolved and was/is it a good direction?',\n",

To my absolute surprise it is not possible to get replacement keycaps for this keyboard and since it is no longer under warranty there is nothing they can do. I would have no problem paying for the replacement keys (within reason) but no, not possible.\\n\\nSo, this three year old keyboard, not the cheapest one either, is now e-waste. Quite frankly, this is unacceptable and I will get rid of my other Logitech keyboards (two MX Mechanical Mini I use at work) as if something breaks they can\\'t offer repairs or replacement parts.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can\\'t even get aftermarket keycaps as I have a German layout and I wasn\\'t able to find anything that would work (and apparently they are just different enough for kailh caps to not fit).',\n",

These switches provide a tactile and audible feedback when pressed, which many users find more satisfying and comfortable than the softer, quieter feel of traditional keyboards. Mechanical keyboards are also known for their durability and long lifespan, as the switches are typically rated for tens of millions of keystrokes.   \\n\\n#',\n",

       "  'body': 'Normal mechanical keyboards require you to reach the actuation point before it registers a keypress, which is set by the specific switch that you\\'re using but let\\'s just say it\\'s halfway down. If you press your key all the way down, then you\\'ll need to let it back up at least past the halfway point before you\\'ll be able to register a new keypress.\\n\\nWooting keyboards (and others that advertise \"Rapid Trigger\" or Hall Effect switches) use a newer type of switch that are different from standard mechanical switches. They allow you to not only set the exact actuation point you want (can be 0.1mm if you want), but they also do not require you to release it back up past the actuation point to register a new press, as soon as you begin to release the press, then you can immediately press down again and it will count it as a new keypress.\\n\\nThis can help massively in stamina and stream heavy maps.',\n",

       "  'body': \"The detection mechanism is the limitation for membrane keyboards, IIRC. For mechanical keyboards you'd be hard-pressed to find one that didn't have theoretical NKRO support (no ghosting in the hardware level). The only other piece of the puzzle is that you have to use the extended USB keyboard spec to report key state with larger data packets, rather than the legacy keyboard spec. NKRO isn't supported by the host in BIOS (dunno about UEFI) so a keyboard with NKRO enabled might not function in the BIOS screens. But every modern operating system has native support for the extended reporting. Most commercial gamer keyboards have a toggle switch for NKRO so it'll still work in BIOS if you turn NKRO off. Same in QMK, et al. They have functions to toggle it and you can set it up to be on by default.\\n\\nThe main reason most don't have it enabled by default/all the time is the BIOS thing coupled with the fact that 6KRO is almost always enough.\",\n",

I'm a senior software engineer.\\n\\nHey guys, since it looks highly probable that I'll be getting a job that would require me to go into the office for a few days a week, I'm looking for a low profile 75% (or 65%) keyboard. For reference, at home I've been driving a Tada68 with my own customized layout via QMK, with DSA keycaps over Aliaz 70g switches. NuPhy seems to make some nice low profile keyboards, but the lack of QMK compatibility kills any chance I'd be happy with them.\\n\\nMy top candidates right now are\\n\\n* Low Profile 75% [KeyChron K3 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) : Looks nice and reviews have been good. Having physical function keys might be nice.\\n* Low Profile 65% [KeyChron K7 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k7-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard): Same layout as my Tada68 and a bit smaller.\\n\\nAny other suggestions or comments on these two keyboards? I've been super happy with my Tada68s for a long time for home use and haven't really looked at upgrading or changing my setup in a long time. I'm actually a bit bewildered by the recent explosion in quality mechanical keyboards.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"1. Dust filters. The less dust gets in your case, the better. Vacuuming the floor around the PC helps. May want to clean the dust off from time to time anyway, as some very small quantities will still get it and accumulate over time.\\n2. Keep liquids off, especially with cases with top mesh or fan opening, but projectile fluids can get in from any direction anyway depending on where you are when you spill them, so just keep the PC somewhere it can't be reached if you spill a coffee. Same goes for mechanical keyboards.\\n3. Keeps pets and children off. Risks are minimal when supervised, but don't underestimate the combined effect of creativity, curiosity and many hours of unsupervised time near the PC. (Kind of like managing room/floor fans with pets and children. The risk is usually low, but you don't want prolonged unsupervised exposure.)\\n4. No CPU installation or any other fragile work when you're tired, sleep, distracted, angry, hurried, jittery, high on caffeine, or after a beer or two. Watch the pins, watch the paste. No hurried jobs. Keep the emotions in check if you need to take the CPU out and put it back in — no more than 2 or 3 unsuccessful attempts in a row is my rule. Treat emotions like responsible drivers treat alcohol. They work kinda the same.\\n5. PSU: You don't have to buy 1200W Titanium, but I wouldn't go below Gold and like 200W surplus. Prefer PSUs that allow you to switch the fan off completely, even manually, to avoid wasting its working hours because PSU fans are a pain to replace. Listen to any new PSU through a vacuum-cleaner pipe or toilet-paper roll to make sure you don't hear coil whine and/or some other nasty sounds. (Do the same acoustic test for GPUs always, and you may want to do it also for soundcards and certain parts of motherboards if you're highly sensitive to sound. But PSU and GPU is kinda mandatory if you're a normal person with the PC case sitting close to where you sit, even several metres/yards).\\n6. This one isn't really about PC health/maintenance, but it comes close and is related: Check manuals and specs and take precise measurements to make sure everything is compatible and there's space for everything. This is less of a problem these days that the stores accept returns more readily but anyway. Don't assume anything, don't rely on calculations based on manual specs if they outcome suggests something like 2mm clearance. Don't brute-force anything unless you really know what you're doing and can manage the financial risk involved.\\n7. The bottom-line takeaway is mostly to avoid doing stupid things or taking stupid risks. Everybody knows this rule, obviously, and mostly follows it, but the difficult task is to control oneself and avoid making exceptions when you're in a hurry or get emotional. **Sticking with the 'don't do stupid' rule 100% of the time as opposed to 99% is the challenge.**\",\n",

       "  'body': 'I have the mechanical one. I\\'ve owned a few mechanical keyboards and bought this because my work mouse is an mx master 3.\\n\\nI regret buying it because I just have seen other keyboards do everything better and from a big company like Logitech I expect more.\\n\\n1. Backlight\\n\\n1a. Unless it\\'s plugged in you can\\'t always have the backlight on. If you\\'re plugging it in why buy a wireless keyboard?\\n1b. The timeout of the lights for the keyboards is 30 seconds and this is not changeable. Now I\\'m a developer so sometimes I\\'m just looking at my code and not typing and when I get ready to type if I had my hand on the keyboard I have to press something for the lights to come on. If my hand wasn\\'t on it fine I just need to hover my hand to turn on the lights but that still takes a second.\\n1c. It wouldn\\'t bother me that much if not for a and b but you only get white lights. Sure I typically only use wight or blue static lights but you are spending 100+ on the keyboard the lights don\\'t stay on and it\\'s only white lights that honestly aren\\'t that bright.\\n\\n2.compatibility with other logitech products \\n2a. The receiver is a logibolt which believe it or not does not work with the majority of productivity mice of logitech. Not the mx master or the triathlon I have. Which is fine if you want to use Bluetooth but at work Bluetooth messes up frequently so that means I need 2 recievers as the keyboard is also not compatible with the unifying receiver. Both the unifying receiver and logibolt receiver are things logitech brags about they don\\'t seem to have put to much effort into them.\\n2b. Flow. All the items I\\'ve mentioned are \"compatible\" with logitech flow. The mice \"work\" but do not switch over the keyboard with them most times. It\\'s maddening because I bought a k380 to test flow before this and that works most time but not this keyboard.\\n2c. Easy switch does not switch the mouse. It\\'s another one of those things that you would think would work and when it doesn\\'t you wonder why u stuck with one brand. I\\'m not gonna mention another brand in this comment but I will say there is another low profile mechanical keyboard with multi device that happens to have some orange keycaps exists I\\'ve tested it and I honestly I should have stuck to.\\n\\n3. It\\'s not the best feeling blue switches\\nI can\\'t speak to the other colors (red or brown) because I don\\'t own them but of the 4 mechanical keyboards I own/owned this only really feels better than the $50 one\\n\\n\\nTldr. The keyboard does everything it says it does and does none of those things well and at its price you really ot to just buy something else or if muti device isn\\'t why you are buying it get a kit and have some fun making your own mechanical keyboard',\n",

Previously I've had xbows yet it could not get well with my muscle memory. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow looking forward to get low-profile switches from K shop with low profile keycaps and let's see as even I'm hitting 90wpm, error rate is around 3-10% still which is not so great even I believe I will learn, I have stil bit bigger hands than average user, keycaps coming on this are quite small for me. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTrackpad in middle and mouse on side is perfect combo as sometimes I need more sensitive horizontal scrolling, where on mouse it's more tactical some other stuff, I've learned lot of keyboard shortcuts for past two weeks and minimized usage of mouse to minimum. \\n\\nI must say that feeling from using this is delicious and feels like heaven and now I know what others been saying about mech keyboards! I'm really happy be around and catching up. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOther things I'm thinking to try would be tilting and tenting  keyboard. I haven't concluded research on this part yet I'm looking forward give it shot. Besides classical keyboard size layout, split layout is delicious relax for my shoulders, arms and hands overall as I have bigger hands than upper average, small keyboards made me bit pain and I had to focus to keep hands close to each other as naturally I have wide shoulders it was pushing me away.\",\n",
